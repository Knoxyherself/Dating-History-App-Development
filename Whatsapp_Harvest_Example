[07/12/2020, 15:07:37] Mr G: They are on my voucher scheme thingy
[07/12/2020, 15:07:44] Sam: The optician has the same prescription as us 😂
[07/12/2020, 15:07:49] Mr G: Which is the only reason I’m doing an eye test 😂
[07/12/2020, 15:07:49] Sam: See if it’s the same lady
[07/12/2020, 15:07:55] Mr G: Ahah ok
[07/12/2020, 18:13:49] Sam: So I asked if non-students could come on the ski trip....

[07/12/2020, 19:35:27] Sam: Yes 😊
[07/12/2020, 19:35:40] Sam: How was the eye test?
[07/12/2020, 19:41:07] Mr G: Great! Surprisingly didn’t get much worse since my last eye test like 12 years ago
[07/12/2020, 19:41:16] Mr G: Have 0.25 in one eye and 0.75
[07/12/2020, 19:41:22] Mr G: How much do you have?
[07/12/2020, 19:41:45] Mr G: And 0.25 astigmatism in each eye
[07/12/2020, 19:43:04] Sam: I’m -1 in both eyes
[07/12/2020, 19:43:15] Mr G: Ah ok
[07/12/2020, 19:43:27] Mr G: Why - or +? I’m - on both as well
[07/12/2020, 19:43:35] Sam: Short sighted
[07/12/2020, 19:43:54] Sam: + is long sighted
[07/12/2020, 19:43:56] Mr G: Is + x ray vision?
[07/12/2020, 19:44:01] Sam: 😂
[07/12/2020, 19:44:02] Mr G: Ah fair
[07/12/2020, 19:44:50] Mr G: I really thought I was at least 1 in both eyes and like 1.5 on the right one
[07/12/2020, 19:45:06] Mr G: I can’t even imagine people with like 4 or 5
[07/12/2020, 19:45:40] Sam: My twin was practically blind until he had laser surgery 😂

[09/12/2020, 16:30:04] Mr G: This is one of the reasons I don’t adhere to these trends. You’re almost always promoting someone’s product
[09/12/2020, 16:32:15] Sam: Wow, I had no idea! I like that account, it’s pretty educational! But I try to ignore every advert on Instagram really. The algorithm they use to target young women is brutal
[09/12/2020, 16:32:31] Mr G: Yeah
[09/12/2020, 16:32:34] Mr G: Same goes with politics
[09/12/2020, 16:32:56] Sam: We’d all be 6 stone, drinking weightloss tea in our magnetic eyelashes if Instagram had its way
[09/12/2020, 16:33:01] Mr G: You think the independent, guardian, buzzfeed care about your progressive ideas ?

[10/12/2020, 10:02:17] Sam: Do you not think boris will throw the toys out of the pram and block the other way too?
[10/12/2020, 10:03:06] Mr G: No, I think that news are speculating and being sensationalist so that they can have dem sweet clicks once again 😂

[10/12/2020, 12:12:19] Mr G: I was looking forward to a party on Saturday
[10/12/2020, 12:12:27] Mr G: So we could do something like that :)
[10/12/2020, 12:12:29] Mr G: If you fancy
[10/12/2020, 12:31:11] Sam: Definitely. There’s 3 litres of mulled wine to get through 😂
[10/12/2020, 12:58:21] Mr G: Ahah awesome
[10/12/2020, 12:58:37] Mr G: Shall we then? What are you discussing with her?
[11/12/2020, 08:50:37] Sam: Do you recommend that 100 days of python course?
[11/12/2020, 08:51:10] Mr G: If you were a complete beginner like me, definitely. Even if not
[11/12/2020, 08:51:20] Mr G: It seems to be covering everything
[11/12/2020, 08:51:41] Mr G: However, from what I understood it will divert a bit more to web later
[11/12/2020, 08:51:52] Sam: Yeah that’s what I need
[11/12/2020, 08:52:02] Sam: My course just covered pure python
[11/12/2020, 08:52:07] Mr G: Web?? You’re joining the dark side? 🤩
[11/12/2020, 08:52:12] Sam: Yeah
[11/12/2020, 08:52:15] Mr G: 🥳
[11/12/2020, 08:52:23] Mr G: Definitely do it !
[11/12/2020, 08:52:33] Mr G: I’ve been loving it, keeps me coding everyday
[11/12/2020, 08:52:49] Sam: Developing a new web-based interface for all of our kpis at work
[11/12/2020, 08:53:35] Mr G: The only thing is that it’s fairly fast paced, in the sense that almost every day you learn something new. If you only do the challenges and don’t practice at all like me you will end up forgetting some of the things. However, I’ve been taking notes and all it takes is a quick look back to refresh my memory
[11/12/2020, 08:53:47] Mr G: Oh wow! And why python?
[11/12/2020, 08:53:52] Mr G: Or is it on python ?

[14/12/2020, 12:03:50] Sam: 🤷🏼‍♀️
[14/12/2020, 12:04:08] Sam: This is going to be mental 😂😂
[14/12/2020, 12:04:46] Mr G: Haha
[14/12/2020, 12:08:21] Mr G: I’m still curious how they are going to pull out a 1k ppl holiday trip as early as April, all things considered
[14/12/2020, 12:09:55] Sam: They seem pretty confident
[14/12/2020, 12:10:06] Sam: I have a lot of friends away snowboarding at the minute
[14/12/2020, 12:10:13] Sam: They seem to be keeping the resorts open
[14/12/2020, 12:10:30] Mr G: Yeah but 1k people..
[14/12/2020, 12:10:37] Mr G: Anyway hope they manage
[14/12/2020, 12:10:57] Sam: It’s the travel there that’s going to be the tricky part I think
[14/12/2020, 12:11:56] Mr G: Yeah. Well and hosting everyone. I imagine everyone will be there to party too, which doesn’t seem very feasible atm
[14/12/2020, 12:12:04] Mr G: Plus quarantine coming back if it still applies
[14/12/2020, 12:24:50] Sam: I’m hoping with the vaccine, things will be better by April 🤞🏼
[14/12/2020, 12:34:13] Mr G: Yes !
[14/12/2020, 13:00:10] Mr G: Did you know you can press&hold the space bar to scroll through characters in a text msg?
[14/12/2020, 13:01:15] Sam: I just press and hold my thumb where I want the cursor to go?
[14/12/2020, 13:01:38] Mr G: Yeah but that has always been awful for me in terms of ux
[14/12/2020, 13:01:45] Mr G: Space bar is so much cleaner
[14/12/2020, 13:01:46] Sam: You’re starting to veer off into super-geek territory now honey....
[14/12/2020, 13:02:08] Mr G: 🤓
[14/12/2020, 13:02:13] Sam: Next you’ll be telling me you know all the ctrl key commands...

[14/12/2020, 13:03:07] Sam: I built a dashboard for production today ☺️
[14/12/2020, 13:03:12] Sam: And it’s not shit!
[14/12/2020, 13:04:00] Mr G: Oh nice!
[14/12/2020, 13:04:02] Mr G: Tableau?
[14/12/2020, 13:04:10] Sam: Yeah
[14/12/2020, 13:31:24] Sam: Just when I thought my winning streak had ended....

[14/12/2020, 13:31:58] Sam: Throw blankie! ✊🏼
[14/12/2020, 13:50:22] Sam: Trip sold out at 1200 places 😳
[14/12/2020, 13:50:52] Mr G: Ahaha
[14/12/2020, 13:50:55] Mr G: What is that ?
[14/12/2020, 13:51:03] Mr G: You’re on a winning streak!
[14/12/2020, 13:51:13] Mr G: Did you manage to book you’re place ?
[14/12/2020, 13:51:23] Sam: Yep ☺️
[14/12/2020, 13:51:39] Mr G: Fab!!
[14/12/2020, 13:51:40] Sam: A snuggly blanket from the computing society ❤️
[14/12/2020, 13:51:57] Mr G: Wished I could join, but it simply isn’t realistic considering my knees
[14/12/2020, 13:52:05] Mr G: Next year if you’re still a student ahah
[14/12/2020, 13:52:23] Sam: I really need to ramp up the gym starting this week
[14/12/2020, 13:52:22] Mr G: Sounds like it’s going to be a blast
[14/12/2020, 13:52:44] Sam: Get my snowboarding thunder thighs back 😂
[14/12/2020, 13:52:50] Sam: Heyyyyyy!!!
[14/12/2020, 13:53:07] Sam: I’m actually thinking about applying to do a phd 😋
[14/12/2020, 15:19:40] Mr G: oh wow!! you're unstoppable! ahah in what?
[14/12/2020, 15:21:10] Mr G: I bought the frames in wilko finally. the pictures are 42 x 52cm which is a little over the standard frame size of 16'' x 20''. I thought that would be accounted for on the frames, but no. Why the hell would you sell art a little over the standard size 🤦🏻‍♂️
[14/12/2020, 15:56:17] Sam: Computer science ☺️ I feel everything I’m learning on my course so far makes me better at my job and benefits the company too, so they go hand in hand. Also Dr Knox sounds totally badass 🤷🏼‍♀️
[14/12/2020, 15:59:53] Sam: What?! Did you have to trim a bit? 
I’m at the library tomorrow so I’ll drop our Christmas present off if you’re home (“our present”... not “your present”) 😬
[14/12/2020, 16:00:36] Mr G: ....our? 😅 what do you mean? That’s from you and someone else or is it for me and you? Ahah
[14/12/2020, 16:00:48] Mr G: I’ll have to trim it probably yes
[14/12/2020, 16:01:03] Mr G: Ahah it does! Thats great
[14/12/2020, 16:01:14] Sam: It’s for me and you. It’s too good. I nearly just kept it for myself 😂
[14/12/2020, 16:01:33] Mr G: Omg I’m super curious now 😂
[14/12/2020, 16:02:00] Sam: It’s gonna need an afternoon, beer and large area of open floor space
[14/12/2020, 16:02:11] Sam: And I’m not giving any more clues 😬
[14/12/2020, 16:02:47] Mr G: Omg
[14/12/2020, 16:03:14] Mr G: Is it something related to dance??
[14/12/2020, 16:03:21] Sam: No.
[14/12/2020, 16:03:25] Sam: No more clues!
[14/12/2020, 16:03:29] Mr G: That’s a clue. I want more
[14/12/2020, 16:03:36] Sam: 😂
[14/12/2020, 16:04:36] Sam: It’s a reason to come back to us after Christmas anyway 😋
[14/12/2020, 16:10:12] Mr G: Aaaah!!!
[14/12/2020, 16:10:15] Mr G: I think I know
[14/12/2020, 16:10:28] Mr G: No wait probably not

[15/12/2020, 10:15:50] Mr G: 0:14s - tourists who got them wrong can be imprisioned or killed
[15/12/2020, 10:15:53] Mr G: 😆
[15/12/2020, 10:35:08] Sam: I feel like Alnwick caught you out
[15/12/2020, 10:35:17] Sam: 😂😂
[15/12/2020, 10:37:14] Mr G: Will never be able to pronounce it properly
[15/12/2020, 10:37:32] Mr G: First time I realised I was in big trouble was when I found out how quayside is pronounced
[15/12/2020, 10:38:43] Sam: https://youtu.be/2N2eSsIWtNI
[15/12/2020, 10:38:55] Sam: My brother just sent me this
[15/12/2020, 10:39:07] Sam: The absolute jerk that he is
[15/12/2020, 10:39:11] Sam: 😭😭
[15/12/2020, 10:39:18] Sam: 🤣🤣
[15/12/2020, 10:39:40] Sam: Us brits are pretty horrible actually 😂
[15/12/2020, 10:42:07] Mr G: Aw I thought this was going to turn funny midway or something
[15/12/2020, 10:42:10] Mr G: Seeet
[15/12/2020, 10:42:13] Mr G: Sweet
[15/12/2020, 10:42:19] Sam: 😭😭😭😭😭😭
‎[15/12/2020, 11:15:23] Sam: ‎image omitted
[15/12/2020, 11:15:30] Sam: Have you been here yet?
[15/12/2020, 11:15:39] Sam: The cakes 😍😍😍😍
[15/12/2020, 11:15:53] Mr G: Oh yeah
[15/12/2020, 11:16:17] Mr G: Before the second lockdown I was going there every Saturday for morning coffee ☺️
[15/12/2020, 11:16:56] Mr G: They’re super nice. Managed to pull out something good, unlike the previous Portuguese restaurant 🙄
[15/12/2020, 11:17:01] Mr G: Have you been there ?
[15/12/2020, 11:17:21] Sam: No but it popped up on the uni page
[15/12/2020, 11:17:21] Mr G: I’ve seen some kizomba people there ahah
[15/12/2020, 11:17:26] Sam: I didn’t even know it was there
[15/12/2020, 11:17:41] Mr G: Yeah
[15/12/2020, 11:17:54] Mr G: We can go there one day when we come down from tier 3
[15/12/2020, 11:18:06] Mr G: Food is really good
[15/12/2020, 11:18:23] Sam: 🙌🏼
[15/12/2020, 11:21:34] Mr G: The girl talking portuguese in the uni story 😅
[15/12/2020, 11:22:53] Sam: Yeah she’s prettyyyy
[15/12/2020, 11:23:18] Sam: She’s the double of our previous grad student
[15/12/2020, 11:23:32] Mr G: In size?

[15/12/2020, 15:34:22] Mr G: Amazing
[15/12/2020, 15:34:48] Mr G: Sorry for mild NSFW
[15/12/2020, 15:36:03] Sam: The English language is taking a battering today 😂😂
[15/12/2020, 15:40:57] Mr G: So... my friend from London left for good today
[15/12/2020, 15:40:59] Mr G: Back to Lisbon
[15/12/2020, 15:41:35] Mr G: Although his tenancy only ends on January
[15/12/2020, 15:42:09] Mr G: He’s not coming back though , so he left the place ready to be taken by the landlady
[15/12/2020, 15:42:37] Mr G: However....he just remembered he left LSD tabs in his bedroom
[15/12/2020, 15:42:39] Mr G: 🤣
[15/12/2020, 15:42:47] Mr G: He’s about to board the plane
[15/12/2020, 15:42:52] Sam: WHAT
[15/12/2020, 15:42:54] Mr G: Now he has to explain that to the landlady
[15/12/2020, 15:43:08] Sam: Is it obvious what they are?
[15/12/2020, 15:43:14] Mr G: Probably
[15/12/2020, 15:43:22] Sam: I mean, obviously you need to remove them
[15/12/2020, 15:43:32] Sam: Who even does LSD 😂🤣😂
[15/12/2020, 15:43:31] Mr G: He completely forgot about it
[15/12/2020, 15:43:39] Sam: Fuck that 😂
[15/12/2020, 15:43:43] Mr G: My crazy friend ahah
[15/12/2020, 15:43:51] Mr G: He’s such a character
[15/12/2020, 15:44:06] Sam: No wonder you were 4 hours late in London 🙃
[15/12/2020, 15:44:11] Sam: 😂😂
[15/12/2020, 15:44:13] Mr G: Ahah
[15/12/2020, 15:44:27] Mr G: Not because of lsd, but I did pick up the keyboard from there
[15/12/2020, 15:44:37] Sam: Uh huhhhhhh
[15/12/2020, 15:44:41] Sam: 😉
[15/12/2020, 15:44:58] Mr G: Oh if it was lsd our trip would be much, much more interesting
[15/12/2020, 15:45:11] Mr G: Specially when I took the wheel
[15/12/2020, 15:45:24] Sam: Can you imagine that drive home 😂😂
[15/12/2020, 15:45:36] Sam: I’m kinda disappointed now
[15/12/2020, 15:46:19] Sam: Maybe we should go and retrieve them?? 🙃🙃🚗✨⚡️✨🌈🤩
[15/12/2020, 15:48:58] Mr G: Hahah
[15/12/2020, 15:49:14] Mr G: Could e
[15/12/2020, 15:50:17] Sam: e??
[15/12/2020, 15:50:27] Sam: Ecstasy too?? 😂
[15/12/2020, 15:50:28] Mr G: Be*!
[15/12/2020, 15:50:50] Mr G: Ahaha calm down! We will have plenty of time to do all of them in 2021
[15/12/2020, 15:51:18] Sam: I’m not touching another pill or edible as long as I live 🙏🏼
[15/12/2020, 15:51:44] Mr G: *and as far as I can control
[15/12/2020, 15:51:47] Mr G: 😂
[15/12/2020, 20:20:33] Mr G: Now I’m all Christmassy listening to these songs 🥰
[15/12/2020, 20:40:11] Sam: Aww I’m glad 😊 we’ll have Christmas 2.0 when you get back
[15/12/2020, 21:00:33] Sam: Also, I had a bit of a wobble today because I got sad that you were going home (I know, it’s just for like a week and a bit 😂 but it feels like more because you’ll be far away) but I think it was just in my head because I feel fine now and not sad at all 😊
Which is really nice because I think we’ve reached that friendship nirvana where I’m not thinking about kissing you all the time 😂
[15/12/2020, 21:00:54] Sam: Only like, 30% of the time 😂
[15/12/2020, 21:01:17] Sam: #friendshipgoals 🙌🏼
[15/12/2020, 21:01:45] Mr G: Even with a nose like this ? 🤪
[15/12/2020, 21:05:16] Mr G: ☺️ that’s very sweet though, I really appreciated the present, makes me feel more at home here. It’s really just a week and a half and tbh As I said I think I would rather stay at this point. Just really looking forward to see my family!
[15/12/2020, 21:05:41] Mr G: I didn’t know that crosses your mind though....
[15/12/2020, 21:20:25] Sam: Yeah it does 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’m not made of stone 😂 

Apart from my brother and my grandad, I’ve never, ever had a guy in my daily life who just cares about me without wanting something (cough) from me. Shaun is great, but I don’t get the feeling he’s going to be in my life for a long time (idk why). 

But I feel like you will be, which is a really nice feeling. I’m not used to ever having that though, so I get my feelings a little mixed up sometimes and don’t really know where the boundaries are. But I’m just really happy you’re in my life anyway ☺️
[15/12/2020, 21:53:33] Mr G: Are you happy with what we have right now ?
[15/12/2020, 22:09:03] Sam: Are you?
[15/12/2020, 23:26:28] Mr G: Yes 😊
[15/12/2020, 23:26:39] Mr G: But I’m the one asking the question 😠
[16/12/2020, 00:05:40] Sam: Well I’m hardly going to say no now 😂
[16/12/2020, 00:07:20] Sam: I’m trying very hard to be
[16/12/2020, 19:53:55] Sam: The twin has landed 🥰 going to take him for a coffee/mulled wine on the quayside tomorrow after work (half 5ish) if you fancy it 😊
[16/12/2020, 21:11:58] Mr G: Great 🥳 are you with him already?
[16/12/2020, 21:12:26] Mr G: Thanks ! I might be able to pop up for a bit, since I’ll be packing and arranging everything before I go :)
[16/12/2020, 21:12:33] Mr G: Let me know when tomorrow !
[16/12/2020, 22:11:27] Sam: Yeah he’s here, the knox household is complete again 😌👩‍👧‍👦
[17/12/2020, 11:35:58] Mr G: 🥰
[17/12/2020, 11:36:18] Mr G: Are you wfh?
[17/12/2020, 11:40:07] Sam: Yeah
[17/12/2020, 11:40:40] Sam: But omg I take it back, these two are driving me crazy 😩😂
[17/12/2020, 11:41:46] Sam: I think I’m gonna go work in the library this afternoon if I can get a study room
[17/12/2020, 11:41:53] Sam: I didn’t even manage 24 hours 😂
[17/12/2020, 13:42:35] Mr G: Omg really? 😅
[17/12/2020, 13:42:44] Mr G: Is it that bad even after 1 year apart ?
‎[17/12/2020, 13:51:25] Sam: ‎image omitted
[17/12/2020, 13:52:00] Sam: They decided to start sorting out the loft right outside my door 😂
[17/12/2020, 13:53:43] Mr G: 😂
[17/12/2020, 13:53:53] Mr G: Christmas problems
[17/12/2020, 13:55:23] Sam: My mum keeps popping her head around the door whilst I’m on work calls asking if I want to keep stuffed toys from 30-odd years ago 🤦🏼‍♀️
[17/12/2020, 13:56:05] Sam: I give you 3 days until you’re having the same family funtimes when you get back 😂
[17/12/2020, 14:00:14] Mr G: Ahah
[17/12/2020, 14:00:39] Mr G: Yeah although during summer it took me a while with my mum
[17/12/2020, 14:00:47] Mr G: This time I’ll stay by myself in Lisbon hehe
[17/12/2020, 14:01:15] Mr G: Maybe when I go to my dads it’ll happen though
[17/12/2020, 14:14:28] Sam: Ahh maintaining personal space, good decision 👍🏼 
I think as soon as work is done, I’ll be able to relax and enjoy it. We have so many nice things to look forward to ☺️
[17/12/2020, 14:20:05] Mr G: Yeah, I realised I really need it last time I went back
[17/12/2020, 15:06:47] Mr G: Do you have any idea what I could offer my mum for her bday+xmas? I’m looking for something within 50-70£ range and small so I can take it with me 😂
[17/12/2020, 15:23:57] Sam: Is she a sentimental jewellery kind of lady?

[17/12/2020, 15:24:32] Mr G: Pandora bracelet was my first idea but I think she already has one...
[17/12/2020, 15:24:55] Sam: This isn’t one of the ones that the charms go onto
[17/12/2020, 15:25:00] Sam: It’s a different design
[17/12/2020, 15:25:02] Mr G: Ah i see
[17/12/2020, 15:25:08] Mr G: Family tree

[17/12/2020, 15:25:42] Sam: Opposite vision express
[17/12/2020, 15:25:50] Mr G: Fab
[17/12/2020, 15:25:51] Mr G: Thanks
[17/12/2020, 15:26:44] Sam: No problemo. I love shopping for other people ☺️💸
[17/12/2020, 15:27:30] Mr G: Oh nice !! Thanks, let me know when you got it so I can pick it up. Or alternatively just wire me 60quid and I’ll pop up there real quick

[18/12/2020, 08:45:46] Sam: Poor Sarah!
[18/12/2020, 08:45:52] Sam: Hope she didn’t have work today
[18/12/2020, 08:46:23] Sam: Going straight to the mum though... that’s a ballsy move

[18/12/2020, 08:47:10] Sam: I’m quite emotional
[18/12/2020, 08:47:28] Sam: This crazy rollercoaster of a year is finally ending
[18/12/2020, 08:47:57] Mr G: Really? Anything in particularly or just the year ending?
[18/12/2020, 08:48:11] Sam: And my boss is buying the fish and chips and I’m not even in the office ☹️ you know how food impacts my emotions
[18/12/2020, 08:52:06] Sam: The whole year, so many crazy highs and lows. I wish I’d kept a diary so I could read it all back in 10 years
[18/12/2020, 09:04:09] Mr G: Ahah noooo! Go there, you might still be on time!!

[18/12/2020, 10:30:28] Mr G: A few further updates from Sarah
[18/12/2020, 10:31:08] Mr G: It sounds like the mum is somewhat proud that her little girl pulled an illegal party
[18/12/2020, 10:50:49] Sam: Maybe she worried that she was a bit nerdy and struggled to make friends... now she knows shes actually a total bad-ass amongst her peers
[18/12/2020, 10:51:17] Sam: Aww that’s nice 😊
[18/12/2020, 16:29:46] Mr G: So we had a 30 min delay due to some technical issues
[18/12/2020, 16:29:47] Mr G: The engineers have come on board and now we are about to take off

[18/12/2020, 16:32:32] Mr G: Represents a sensation of dread
[18/12/2020, 16:33:03] Sam: A g&t fixes all sense of dread 😉
[18/12/2020, 16:33:31] Sam: Anyway, fly safe, try not to breathe the germy air and let me know when you land 😊✈️

[19/12/2020, 00:31:20] Mr G: Where my hdd decided to commit suicide from my desk 😂
[19/12/2020, 00:32:02] Mr G: Any evidence of my existence before 2015 was vanished thus my existence itself before that time is merely hypothetical
[19/12/2020, 08:46:38] Sam: Awwwww look at that wee baby face 😍
[19/12/2020, 08:46:51] Sam: 😂😂 the big fall of 2015

[19/12/2020, 21:35:35] Sam: Ah nice, so bars are open there?
[19/12/2020, 21:36:58] Mr G: The thing is that In ncl you don’t even consider staying too much outside unless with proper clothes. Here you stay out the whole afternoon but it’s not that much warmer
[19/12/2020, 21:37:04] Mr G: Outside of Lisbon
[19/12/2020, 21:37:13] Mr G: I just came back and there’s nothing to do

[20/12/2020, 13:06:02] Sam: No but I was very VERY tempted
[20/12/2020, 13:29:36] Mr G: I’m having trouble deciding if I should go to the social
[20/12/2020, 13:29:51] Mr G: I think it’s a bit risky considering it will be less than a day before I get tested
[20/12/2020, 13:29:59] Mr G: And then I’ll be with my family
[20/12/2020, 13:39:03] Mr G: Decided not to go
[20/12/2020, 13:39:09] Mr G: It was difficult

[20/12/2020, 14:12:18] Mr G: Well you can sneak a little squeeze now
[20/12/2020, 14:12:31] Mr G: Babies are immortal as far as COVID is concerned
[20/12/2020, 14:14:17] Sam: Little Theo was mesmerised... he was born the weekend the first lockdown started and his mummy and daddy both have short dark hair, so he’s not used to blondes
[20/12/2020, 14:14:34] Sam: Literally just stared at me for an hour 😂😳
[20/12/2020, 14:14:45] Mr G: 🥸🤌

[20/12/2020, 15:40:43] Mr G: But not that warm. They are just exercising
[20/12/2020, 20:57:49] Mr G: Guess I’ll have some extended holidays ahah
[20/12/2020, 20:59:31] Sam: How come? Are they cancelling flights again?
[20/12/2020, 20:59:30] Mr G: I’m laughing but it’s not funny
[20/12/2020, 20:59:35] Mr G: My plants will die
[20/12/2020, 20:59:44] Mr G: They are talking about closing the borders
[20/12/2020, 21:00:12] Sam: I drove past your house today and I wondered how they were doing 😔 I knew they should have come to stay with their Aunty Sam
[20/12/2020, 21:00:26] Sam: What?? In Portugal??
[20/12/2020, 21:00:26] Mr G: Ahah
[20/12/2020, 21:00:36] Sam: I’m doing dance classes and just avoiding the news
[20/12/2020, 21:00:38] Mr G: You’ve grown attached to them!!
[20/12/2020, 21:00:42] Mr G: Yeah
[20/12/2020, 21:00:47] Mr G: Because of this new strain
[20/12/2020, 21:00:58] Sam: I think it’s safe to say, my knee is completed fu*ked now
[20/12/2020, 21:00:57] Mr G: I think Italy Belgium and Netherlands have closed
[20/12/2020, 21:01:00] Mr G: Spain maybe
[20/12/2020, 21:01:09] Mr G: Noooo
[20/12/2020, 21:01:12] Sam: Bloody hell, I knew something would happen
[20/12/2020, 21:01:14] Mr G: Stop pushing it too much
[20/12/2020, 21:01:18] Sam: It’s never just straight forward
[20/12/2020, 21:01:17] Mr G: What happened ?
[20/12/2020, 21:01:45] Sam: I’m not, but my whole body feels so yucky, I need to move! The lump is back and worse 😟
[20/12/2020, 21:01:56] Sam: It’s all squishy 🤢
[20/12/2020, 21:02:14] Sam: I think they just need to chop this leg off and be done with it
[20/12/2020, 21:02:40] Sam: Did they say when they would decide on the borders? I’ll watch the news after this
[20/12/2020, 21:04:38] Mr G: You really need to be careful. You know that knees take time to heal, and getting help now is more difficult than ever
[20/12/2020, 21:04:52] Mr G: Get more on the bike!
[20/12/2020, 21:05:30] Sam: 🥺
[20/12/2020, 21:05:32] Mr G: Tbh I haven’t really had time to watch the news, I was out all day. But all my friends are asking me if I’ll be allowed to return
[20/12/2020, 21:07:51] Sam: Have you had a nice day?
[20/12/2020, 21:11:56] Mr G: Very good!
[20/12/2020, 21:12:37] Mr G: Had breakfast with Joao. Then went to the beach for coffee&code....illegally because I wasn’t supposed to leave Lisbon 🥸
[20/12/2020, 21:12:51] Mr G: João was adamant of breaking the law as well but joined the life of crime
[20/12/2020, 21:12:59] Mr G: Then a friend I haven’t seen since summer joined as well
[20/12/2020, 21:13:44] Mr G: And we bonded for the whole afternoon through the webs of the law
[20/12/2020, 21:14:10] Mr G: Finally had dinner with that friend in a nice Mexican place and proceeded to come back to gotham where everything is closed and dark
[20/12/2020, 21:14:25] Mr G: You?
[20/12/2020, 21:59:19] Sam: You’re a bad influence 😂
[20/12/2020, 21:59:32] Sam: Sounds like a lovely day!
[20/12/2020, 22:00:56] Sam: Mine was good, hung out with Jayne in the morning and went to the ouseburn and quayside markets, ate waaaay too much food, drank some mulled wine, when spent time with my friends and their babies this afternoon. Finished my Xmas shopping and did a lil dance. Snuggled now trying to decide between Netflix or 🐍
[20/12/2020, 22:19:37] Mr G: Ahahah
[20/12/2020, 22:19:41] Mr G: Python all the way
[20/12/2020, 22:19:51] Mr G: About to start as well 🤓
[20/12/2020, 22:20:13] Mr G: Great, sounds fun as well ☺️ Seems like you’re really getting on with the mulled wine ahah

[21/12/2020, 16:28:32] Sam: I switched to tinder, the quality of man on bumble was poor at best
[21/12/2020, 16:28:48] Mr G: Oof 🙄

[21/12/2020, 16:36:17] Mr G: Can’t blame the guy for being honest though
[21/12/2020, 16:36:30] Mr G: Well seems like tinder is not that much better than bumble 😂
[21/12/2020, 16:37:14] Mr G: Is he the handsome inmate type?
[21/12/2020, 16:37:23] Sam: To be fair, he’s more honest than just about every guy I’ve dated in his bio alone 😂
[21/12/2020, 16:38:09] Mr G: Maybe his crime is heinous though
[21/12/2020, 16:38:11] Mr G: Like
[21/12/2020, 16:38:17] Mr G: Stole a snickers bar from a Tesco
[21/12/2020, 16:38:48] Sam: I’m gonna hold out for someone who is at least employed...
[21/12/2020, 16:38:47] Mr G: Who hasn’t a record in Newcastle though? 😂
[21/12/2020, 16:39:08] Sam: Well that’s offensive 😳
[21/12/2020, 16:39:21] Mr G: Haha jk
[21/12/2020, 16:39:52] Mr G: My first months in byker traumatised me
[21/12/2020, 19:01:47] Sam: Just had a last minute appointment at Nuffield
[21/12/2020, 19:02:18] Sam: Dr said knee is healing just fine
[21/12/2020, 19:02:21] Sam: Phew
[21/12/2020, 19:41:23] Mr G: That’s great!!
[21/12/2020, 19:41:32] Mr G: But really, take it easy
[21/12/2020, 19:41:34] Mr G: Easier
[21/12/2020, 19:42:03] Mr G: I’ve been hearing that my knee is just fine for almost 2 years and I still can’t run or do anything without feeling some pain
[21/12/2020, 20:19:52] Sam: I will 😇
‎[21/12/2020, 20:57:09] Sam: ‎image omitted
[21/12/2020, 20:57:27] Sam: Just a teeeeeny bit of Andrea 😬🥺
[21/12/2020, 21:32:01] Sam: So what did I say the other day about Shaun?? 
Getting it both barrels off him tonight about how I’m a bad friend 🤷🏼‍♀️
[21/12/2020, 21:39:39] Sam: You can tell he’s spent the weekend with Chloe and Luisa 🙄
[21/12/2020, 21:49:34] Mr G: From what I remembered that he got a job?
[21/12/2020, 21:49:42] Mr G: Really? What is he saying??
[21/12/2020, 21:50:43] Mr G: I talked with him about the party and congratulated him about him getting a job! Was it supposed to be a secret? 😕
[21/12/2020, 21:50:56] Mr G: Sorry if it was, I thought it would be nice
[21/12/2020, 21:51:27] Sam: No, it wasn’t a secret
[21/12/2020, 21:52:25] Sam: He sent me a voicemail today asking for a reference for another job but I was literally sweating up a ladder doing hot DIY girl shit, and didn’t get back to him. Then hospital, then finally food
[21/12/2020, 21:52:53] Sam: So he’s just text me saying that I always avoid him when I don’t want to help him out instead of just telling him straight
[21/12/2020, 21:53:06] Sam: Then reeled off a load of examples about times I’ve let him down
[21/12/2020, 21:53:49] Sam: Like refusing to get a motorbike in my name on my insurance for him... which I explained was ILLEGAL
[21/12/2020, 21:55:10] Sam: WHY DONT PEOPLE JUST LET ME LOVE THEM AS FRIENDS WITHOUT BEING DICKS
[21/12/2020, 21:55:25] Sam: that wasn’t supposed to be in caps, but it kinda works ☺️
[21/12/2020, 23:02:50] Mr G: 😂
[21/12/2020, 23:02:53] Mr G: Driving
[21/12/2020, 23:02:57] Mr G: Text later
[21/12/2020, 23:34:35] Sam: Did someone illegally cross the border again...... 🥸
[22/12/2020, 00:05:35] Mr G: Ahaha no
[22/12/2020, 00:05:49] Mr G: Because during the week we’re allowed out till 23h
[22/12/2020, 00:06:08] Mr G: You know, because covid has a strict schedule depending on the day of the week
[22/12/2020, 00:06:32] Mr G: That seems a bit out of nowhere? Why does he say that?
[22/12/2020, 00:07:06] Mr G: Did you fall out completely or was just a fit?
[22/12/2020, 00:07:27] Mr G: That does seem sketchy 😅
[22/12/2020, 11:21:54] Sam: https://www.accenture.com/gb-en/careers/jobdetails?id=00867243_en-GB&title=Client+Delivery+Graduate+Programme+2021-2022

[23/12/2020, 14:47:02] Sam: I’m trying to only meet people outside of our family bubble outside until after Xmas, which is what I told Shaun when I said I couldn’t go to his party
[23/12/2020, 14:47:33] Sam: Chris and Mary have just isolated for 10 days, so we knew they were zero risk
[23/12/2020, 14:51:45] Mr G: It’s understandable !
[23/12/2020, 14:52:04] Mr G: You can go later maybe when the weather is better

[25/12/2020, 21:18:56] Sam: Probably just the two-step
[25/12/2020, 22:06:07] Mr G: Ok probably this is not very legal after all 😅
[25/12/2020, 22:06:15] Mr G: They can be opened til 1am
[25/12/2020, 22:06:26] Mr G: But they can only serve food and drinks to sitting customers
[25/12/2020, 22:06:31] Mr G: Not this travesty!!
[25/12/2020, 22:13:45] Sam: And you’re surprised?? 😂😂
[25/12/2020, 22:14:07] Sam: Please don’t get arrested, your too far away to bail out
[25/12/2020, 22:18:42] Mr G: No, I was surprised it was completely legal
[26/12/2020, 07:17:51] Sam: Did you make it home okay?
[26/12/2020, 10:52:19] Mr G: Yes ☺️
[26/12/2020, 20:11:32] Mr G: So many pregnant friends
[26/12/2020, 20:15:52] Sam: Tell me about it. My brother and I are some of the only childless ones in our group now
[26/12/2020, 21:21:42] Mr G: In my case hasn’t reached the inner group
[26/12/2020, 21:21:58] Mr G: But all around Facebook is just pregnant friends
[26/12/2020, 21:26:34] Sam: I was more amazed at how many girls in my class are lesbians now 😂
[26/12/2020, 21:28:16] Sam: NYE is hitting the fan 🤦🏼‍♀️
[26/12/2020, 21:29:54] Mr G: ?

[26/12/2020, 21:30:19] Sam: Some, yeah 😂
[26/12/2020, 21:30:40] Sam: Vicky isn’t having her party anymore
[26/12/2020, 22:02:22] Mr G: Ah she’s merging the party with chloe’s right? :/

[26/12/2020, 22:03:55] Sam: I booked an airb&b to avoid the whole thing
[26/12/2020, 22:04:08] Sam: And it got cancelled ☹️
[26/12/2020, 22:33:37] Mr G: Come on, everyone knows and likes you. I’m sure she’d understand! Plus she knows your brother too?
[26/12/2020, 22:33:56] Mr G: And I still believe in both of you 😅

[26/12/2020, 22:34:54] Sam: Yes
[26/12/2020, 22:35:14] Sam: She thought I’d been invited when she said yes
[26/12/2020, 22:35:33] Sam: And now she doesn’t want to go 🤦🏼‍♀️
[26/12/2020, 22:35:50] Mr G: ...
[26/12/2020, 22:36:04] Mr G: Has she spoken with Chloe about it?
[26/12/2020, 22:36:33] Sam: No
[26/12/2020, 22:38:54] Sam: But I think she will
[26/12/2020, 22:40:49] Sam: I don’t want a drama. I don’t want to go to any big parties anyway 🤦🏼‍♀️
[26/12/2020, 23:58:11] Mr G: I would like for us to spend all together...
[27/12/2020, 00:01:19] Sam: Yeah me too

[27/12/2020, 00:05:55] Sam: I don’t know which would be worse - a 10k fine or getting kicked out of uni 😂
[27/12/2020, 00:06:07] Mr G: 10k?!
[27/12/2020, 00:06:14] Sam: We’d be the two sliding down the drainpipe if the cops come
[27/12/2020, 00:11:48] Mr G: But 10k ?
[27/12/2020, 00:13:00] Sam: Fines start at £1000k and go up from there
[27/12/2020, 00:13:05] Sam: £1000
[27/12/2020, 00:13:07] Sam: 😂

‎[27/12/2020, 00:24:01] Mr G: ‎image omitted
[27/12/2020, 00:25:26] Sam: Usually just before new year, then one party rolls right into the next one 😁
[27/12/2020, 00:25:57] Sam: I have a jumper on, a duvet and a blanket and still feel cold 😂
[27/12/2020, 00:26:21] Mr G: Ahah nice. Here I think it’s ok the 6th or something like that. It’s a huge holiday in Spain, we just eat some cake and destroy the tree
[27/12/2020, 00:26:45] Mr G: I was so cold today
[27/12/2020, 00:26:52] Mr G: Really, felt colder here than there
[27/12/2020, 00:27:00] Sam: Well ours is plastic, so it’s just gets shoved back up in the loft 😂 no ceremony required
[27/12/2020, 00:27:18] Mr G: YOU HAVE TO DESTROY IT 😠
[27/12/2020, 00:27:31] Sam: No!!!
[27/12/2020, 00:27:37] Sam: That would be wasting plastic
[27/12/2020, 00:27:42] Sam: Think of the turtles!!

[27/12/2020, 00:34:44] Mr G: Ok there’s this huge storm which spans from Spain to the uk
[27/12/2020, 00:35:01] Mr G: Just what I need for my flight
[27/12/2020, 00:37:39] Sam: You’re not having much luck with these flights 🤦🏼‍♀️
[27/12/2020, 01:44:46] Mr G: No

[27/12/2020, 12:31:34] Mr G: Ahaha
[27/12/2020, 14:07:12] Mr G: I just found out my ex has a boyfriend
[27/12/2020, 14:07:16] Mr G: I kind of suspected
[27/12/2020, 14:20:05] Sam: Wait till the day you find out she gets married *punch to the gut*
[27/12/2020, 14:21:49] Sam: It doesn’t matter how much time passes, this stuff still sucks
[27/12/2020, 14:28:04] Mr G: Yeah
[27/12/2020, 14:28:06] Mr G: I mean
[27/12/2020, 14:28:11] Mr G: I’m deffo happy for her
[27/12/2020, 14:28:28] Mr G: But it’s a moment I’ve been waiting for for a while even though not actually thinking about it
[27/12/2020, 14:31:53] Mr G: She texted me in September saying that she wanted me to wait for her as she wanted the same.
Then I texted her last week asking how was she doing because I knew her brother caught covid, and she responded very distantly
[27/12/2020, 14:32:28] Mr G: Anyway! Life 😅
[27/12/2020, 14:33:31] Sam: She wanted the same?
[27/12/2020, 14:39:38] Mr G: She wanted me to wait for you and wanted me to want her to wait for me 😅
[27/12/2020, 14:46:03] Sam: I’m totally confused, but I’m zapping you a hug anyway because you can be happy for someone and still a bit sad it didn’t work out the way you wanted
[27/12/2020, 14:47:31] Mr G: I was confused too 😅 no worries. Basically reminisce of past feelings from her. And I think from me too
[27/12/2020, 14:47:34] Mr G: It’s all too nostalgic
[27/12/2020, 14:48:24] Mr G: It actually worked out how I wanted. I wanted it to end. But not because we didn’t like each other, that was never an issue
[27/12/2020, 14:48:29] Mr G: Anyway, virtual hug haha
[27/12/2020, 14:49:07] Mr G: I still come across this random picture of us and feel weird every now and then
[27/12/2020, 14:53:17] Sam: I get it. Every time Anton has another baby with his wife it still sucks and we broke up 10 years ago... and it was all my decision 🤷🏼‍♀️
[27/12/2020, 14:54:11] Sam: But you’re meant to be living your best hoe life now 🙌🏼
[27/12/2020, 14:54:25] Mr G: Ahaha
[27/12/2020, 14:54:39] Mr G: Ho
[27/12/2020, 14:59:07] Mr G: Is he bigger than me
[27/12/2020, 14:59:09] Mr G: AHAHAHAHAH
[27/12/2020, 14:59:10] Mr G: Sorry
[27/12/2020, 15:00:36] Mr G: I’m joking this is not affecting me that much
[27/12/2020, 15:01:31] Sam: Have you had a drink? 😂😂
[27/12/2020, 15:02:32] Mr G: Ahah not yet

[28/12/2020, 16:43:14] Mr G: I’m very tempted to find out who this guy is
[28/12/2020, 16:43:34] Mr G: All I know is that I don’t know him, and that his half Chinese
[28/12/2020, 16:43:41] Mr G: But i don’t really need this
[28/12/2020, 16:44:10] Sam: ???
[28/12/2020, 16:47:36] Sam: 👉🏼

[28/12/2020, 16:50:33] Mr G: No I’m just in Edinburg
[28/12/2020, 16:50:41] Sam: 🤨
[28/12/2020, 16:50:47] Mr G: What?
[28/12/2020, 16:51:01] Mr G: What’s troubling my young padawan
[28/12/2020, 16:51:05] Mr G: Troubling you
[28/12/2020, 16:51:10] Sam: ????
[28/12/2020, 16:51:20] Sam: What are you talking about? 😂😂
[28/12/2020, 16:51:24] Mr G: Ahah
[28/12/2020, 16:51:27] Sam: Who?!!
[28/12/2020, 16:51:27] Mr G: Never mind
[28/12/2020, 16:51:38] Sam: 🤯
[28/12/2020, 16:51:46] Mr G: It’s not that important
[28/12/2020, 16:52:00] Sam: I’ve had a tough day, just tell me about fun and fluffy things 😂

[28/12/2020, 16:53:04] Mr G: Ah I see you’ve put the man to work
[28/12/2020, 16:53:12] Sam: Of course
[28/12/2020, 16:53:22] Sam: That’s why I need a boyfriend by the time he goes home
[28/12/2020, 16:53:34] Sam: Or I’m gonna be left with half a ceiling 😂
[28/12/2020, 16:53:42] Mr G: Marine will fit the purpose
[28/12/2020, 16:54:52] Sam: Maz is actually the best assistant a girl could ask for. I might see if he’s free instead. At least that way I don’t need to bother putting on makeup 😂
[28/12/2020, 16:57:09] Mr G: 😂
[28/12/2020, 19:48:05] Mr G: Wanna have lunch tomorrow?
[28/12/2020, 19:48:08] Mr G: Or a cuppa
[28/12/2020, 20:10:01] Sam: Sounds good 😊
[28/12/2020, 20:10:12] Sam: 2ish okay?
[28/12/2020, 20:10:23] Sam: Are you back now?
[28/12/2020, 20:50:11] Mr G: Yeah finally
[28/12/2020, 20:50:13] Mr G: Freezing
[28/12/2020, 21:09:39] Sam: Was the flight okay? Think it’s gonna snow later this week 😍☃️
[28/12/2020, 21:26:30] Mr G: Super smooth crisply 🙂
[28/12/2020, 21:26:40] Mr G: Yeah I saw it! Hope it does !!
[28/12/2020, 21:26:52] Mr G: Last winter was a joke 😂
[28/12/2020, 21:36:05] Mr G: Is John always short for Johnathan ?
[28/12/2020, 21:44:13] Sam: Not always, sometimes John is just John
[28/12/2020, 21:44:25] Sam: My brother has an unusual spelling
[28/12/2020, 21:44:40] Sam: Usually it’s Jonathan (no h)
[28/12/2020, 21:45:08] Sam: But but my mum wanted him to be named after her favourite grandad John
[28/12/2020, 21:45:16] Mr G: Wtf crisply, I don’t know what I meant 😂
[28/12/2020, 21:45:26] Mr G: Oh cool
[28/12/2020, 21:45:32] Sam: You’ve been chatting shit for days 😂
[28/12/2020, 21:45:35] Mr G: Well tell Johnathan to join us tomorrow ahah
[28/12/2020, 21:45:50] Sam: He’s having drinks in the park with his friends
[28/12/2020, 21:46:16] Sam: Which makes him sound like a total scally 😂
[28/12/2020, 21:46:21] Sam: They’re keeping it classy
[28/12/2020, 21:46:41] Sam: We can meet them for a bit if you want?
[28/12/2020, 21:47:03] Mr G: 😂
[28/12/2020, 21:47:16] Mr G: Don’t think I’ll have much time for that tomorrow at lunchtime
[28/12/2020, 21:47:43] Sam: No worries, he’s here till the 7th now, his flight got rescheduled
[28/12/2020, 21:47:56] Sam: Also, you’re meant to be isolating 😉

[29/12/2020, 11:43:36] Sam: Still want to do lunch / coffee today?
[29/12/2020, 11:43:57] Mr G: Sure
[29/12/2020, 11:44:05] Mr G: Do you want to pop down to mine ?
[29/12/2020, 11:44:29] Sam: Yeah can do
[29/12/2020, 11:44:36] Mr G: At 14?
[29/12/2020, 11:44:41] Sam: Want me to get anything?
[29/12/2020, 11:44:47] Sam: Yeah 2pm
[29/12/2020, 11:45:00] Mr G: Are you having food as well or just coffee ?
[29/12/2020, 11:45:21] Sam: Probably just coffee
[29/12/2020, 11:45:30] Mr G: Alright

[29/12/2020, 18:34:55] Mr G: Ahaha
[29/12/2020, 18:35:10] Mr G: Are you drinking beer out of your cute baby yoda?
[29/12/2020, 18:35:44] Sam: He’s having a bath but I plan on having a boozy hot chocolate out of him as soon as he’s done ☺️
[29/12/2020, 20:40:04] Sam: Vicky text me asking to go round tonight. I’m obvs too drunk to drive, but I feel like she won’t take no for an answer on NYE and it would be fun. And I bought a dress 😬 If the party is at rezis and you’re going, can we go together?
[29/12/2020, 20:41:21] Mr G: Haha I’m actually walking there now. What do you mean together? I think (not yet sure) the idea was to join at her place first for a pre drink and then we would all go there
[29/12/2020, 20:41:24] Mr G: No?
[29/12/2020, 20:42:00] Sam: Oh if that’s that plan, that’s fine
[29/12/2020, 20:42:10] Sam: I just meant not walking in on my own
[29/12/2020, 20:42:26] Mr G: Oh sure
[29/12/2020, 20:42:33] Mr G: Nobody walks alone
[29/12/2020, 20:42:46] Sam: Haha not together together 😂😂

[30/12/2020, 10:33:30] Sam: Wtf?!
[30/12/2020, 13:04:03] Sam: My grandad is going into hospital ☹️
[30/12/2020, 13:15:08] Mr G: What happened ?
[30/12/2020, 13:20:11] Sam: He’s just got really weak in the last few days. I hope my mum can go in with him, it’s going to be awful if he’s on his own
[30/12/2020, 13:20:36] Mr G: Why wouldn’t she be able to go? Covid ?
[30/12/2020, 13:21:29] Sam: Yeah
[30/12/2020, 13:28:07] Mr G: Shit :/
[30/12/2020, 13:28:10] Mr G: I hope it’s nothing!
[30/12/2020, 15:23:39] Sam: Tier 4 🤦🏼‍♀️

[30/12/2020, 22:49:47] Mr G: How’s your grandpa ?
[30/12/2020, 22:56:37] Sam: Not good 😔
[30/12/2020, 22:56:52] Sam: He’s got hypothermia
[30/12/2020, 23:04:52] Mr G: :(
[30/12/2020, 23:05:11] Mr G: What caused it ?
[30/12/2020, 23:10:29] Sam: His bloodwork shows he’s got an infection but they’re not sure where
[30/12/2020, 23:36:48] Sam: Anyway, I’ll not be going tomorrow in case there’s any chance I’ll be allowed to visit him next week
[31/12/2020, 10:01:40] Mr G: Ok I understand!
[31/12/2020, 10:01:53] Mr G: I really hope he gets better 🤞🏻
[31/12/2020, 10:02:09] Mr G: I’m not sure what’s happening today anyway with tier 4
[31/12/2020, 10:02:15] Mr G: We might not go to rezi s
[31/12/2020, 10:02:45] Sam: They called last night and asked for our permission to resuscitate if he gets any worse 😔 he was fine a few days ago
[31/12/2020, 10:27:28] Mr G: 😔
[31/12/2020, 10:28:08] Mr G: Were there any news overnight about his condition?
[31/12/2020, 10:29:33] Sam: They just said he’s very very poorly and we need to be prepared that it won’t be good news
[31/12/2020, 10:30:14] Sam: I’m not ready to lose my grandad 😢
[31/12/2020, 10:32:43] Mr G: 😞
[31/12/2020, 10:32:47] Mr G: Stay positive!
[31/12/2020, 10:35:18] Sam: I’m trying for my mum
[31/12/2020, 10:44:21] Sam: In the plus side. Tiny nanna is coming to stay with us again
[31/12/2020, 10:44:42] Sam: This is going to be cosy 😂
[31/12/2020, 11:42:40] Mr G: 😅
[31/12/2020, 11:42:49] Mr G: Your house will be full
[31/12/2020, 14:17:26] Mr G: I cringe a bit in bumble. Profiles are almost always the same. Selfie, duck face selfie, selfie in the toilet, selfie in the bedroom, selfie with instagram filters, photo in Lake District if you’re feeling adventurous
[31/12/2020, 14:18:45] Mr G: Oh and loads of photos drinking how could I forget

[31/12/2020, 14:25:51] Sam: The women I match with are much better 🤷🏼‍♀️
[31/12/2020, 14:26:13] Sam: But I’m not looking for 21 year olds for “a bit of fun” 🙄
[31/12/2020, 14:28:48] Mr G: I’m not sure how to respond to any of those messages 😅
[31/12/2020, 14:55:09] Sam: Maybe increase your age range and location?
[31/12/2020, 14:56:02] Sam: As a representative of the 30+ living more than a mile from the city centre category, we’re not all complete write offs 😂 and not a drinking/filter/bathroom/bedroom photo in sight 💁🏼‍♀️
[31/12/2020, 14:59:19] Sam: Also tinder is better. It’s unnatural for feminine women to make the first move
[31/12/2020, 15:33:59] Mr G: What about equality and empowering ?
[31/12/2020, 15:36:01] Mr G: I was not particularly looking for advice, I’ve lost faith in these apps here 😅 from my experience I’ve found that the algorithm treats men and women pretty different given the ratio being so disproportionate. So the app tends to be quite good on the first week of installing/moving places and then it’s just crap after that
[31/12/2020, 15:37:43] Mr G: That’s why they work better when travelling
[31/12/2020, 15:53:28] Sam: All lies 😂
[31/12/2020, 18:43:57] Mr G: python challenge of today is about tinder, and dr angela is actually talking about the algorithm xD
[31/12/2020, 19:01:11] Sam: It’s a sign, slide into her DMs! 😉
[31/12/2020, 19:06:35] Sam: I learning Apache spark tonight

[31/12/2020, 19:08:54] Sam: Big data
[31/12/2020, 19:09:11] Sam: Got my non alcoholic beer and everything
[31/12/2020, 19:15:33] Mr G: Wow
[31/12/2020, 19:15:47] Mr G: Go hardcore and drink + code
[01/01/2021, 00:34:23] Sam: Happy new year mister! I hope it brings you everything you want 😊❤️🥳
[01/01/2021, 00:39:00] Mr G: Happy new year!!! I really hope this year brings the best for you, you deserve it 🤗
[01/01/2021, 00:39:05] Mr G: I wished you could be here
[01/01/2021, 00:39:14] Mr G: All the best for you and your family
[01/01/2021, 13:32:04] Mr G: Did you have a good night ?
[01/01/2021, 13:35:25] Sam: It was lovely having my nanna there, like a big family sleepover, but everyone was so worried about my grandad 😔 he’s managed to eat something this morning though, so hopefully he’s over the worst of it
[01/01/2021, 13:35:39] Sam: Did you have a nice night?
[01/01/2021, 14:16:06] Mr G: Yes let’s hope so! Glad you could be with your family :)
[01/01/2021, 14:16:12] Mr G: Yes was quite fun
[01/01/2021, 14:16:19] Mr G: Although I’m dead
[01/01/2021, 14:16:32] Mr G: Drunk a bit too much
[01/01/2021, 15:26:03] Sam: I’ve just finished a 6 hour shift at the house... I’ve finally got a room that somewhat resembles a bedroom! 🙌🏼🥳
[01/01/2021, 16:00:40] Mr G: Nice! Pics or didn’t happen haha

[01/01/2021, 16:09:27] Mr G: As always, putting the man to work 😂
[01/01/2021, 16:13:33] Sam: Apart from Maz, once in a blue moon, when do I ever have a man to help me?!
[01/01/2021, 16:17:48] Sam: I need to keep him busy anyway, my brother needs to be doing something at all times or else he gets bored 😂
[01/01/2021, 16:28:16] Mr G: Win win then 😂
[01/01/2021, 17:08:45] Sam: Haven’t even had a happy new year off Shaun 🤷🏼‍♀️
[01/01/2021, 17:09:05] Mr G: So
[01/01/2021, 17:09:34] Mr G: Shaun didn’t have a good ending of a night
[01/01/2021, 17:09:54] Sam: Let me guess
[01/01/2021, 17:10:20] Sam: Drama relating to Chloe or Rezi?? 🤔
[01/01/2021, 17:10:29] Mr G: Yeah, how do you know?
[01/01/2021, 17:11:05] Sam: Well he’s been weird with me since he started hanging out with them and it was never going to end well....
[01/01/2021, 17:11:14] Mr G: Weird
[01/01/2021, 17:11:20] Mr G: I’m completely out as usual
[01/01/2021, 17:11:25] Sam: Don’t tell me, I don’t want to know
[01/01/2021, 17:11:32] Sam: I want to stay out of all of it
[01/01/2021, 17:11:44] Mr G: Best
[01/01/2021, 17:11:54] Sam: I’m having a drama free 2021 😌
[01/01/2021, 17:12:29] Sam: He can find me if he needs me but I’m not chasing him to be my friend
[01/01/2021, 17:12:35] Mr G: I didn’t want to share because I don’t think it brings any good to it. But since you said that about Shaun I just want you to know that he’s not having the best beginning of the year
[01/01/2021, 17:12:49] Sam: He brings it on himself
[01/01/2021, 17:13:08] Mr G: I really don’t understand
[01/01/2021, 17:13:32] Sam: It’s who he is 🤷🏼‍♀️
[01/01/2021, 17:14:17] Mr G: Anyway
[01/01/2021, 17:14:22] Mr G: I don’t want to feed the drama
[01/01/2021, 17:14:45] Sam: Come and join me in blissful ignorance
[01/01/2021, 17:14:50] Sam: It’s heavenly 😂
[01/01/2021, 17:15:20] Mr G: It’s too late for that regarding this 😂 but it’s me who tell you that. I’ve never really came down from heaven regarding that 😂
[01/01/2021, 17:15:59] Mr G: To a dramaless 2021 !
[01/01/2021, 17:16:08] Sam: 🍾
[01/01/2021, 17:16:28] Sam: Oh and a sober one! 💪🏼 (for me, anyway)
[01/01/2021, 17:17:37] Mr G: Going ahead with that ?
[01/01/2021, 17:18:09] Sam: Definitely. I haven’t had a good drunk experience in so long and it ruins my day the next day
[01/01/2021, 17:18:42] Sam: This is going to be a productive year
[01/01/2021, 17:18:51] Mr G: Yes! 💪🏻
[01/01/2021, 17:19:24] Mr G: It’s a good time to stop drinking too, not much peer pressure
[01/01/2021, 17:19:40] Mr G: No pubs, no after work socials, no socials whatsoever tbh 😅
[01/01/2021, 17:19:48] Sam: Just need to stay away from vicky, she’s the bad influence 😂
[01/01/2021, 17:19:56] Mr G: Completely ahah
[01/01/2021, 17:20:13] Mr G: She’s so funny though, good party spirit
[01/01/2021, 17:20:31] Mr G: Doesn’t take a no easily when it comes to drinking 😅
[01/01/2021, 17:20:45] Sam: She’s practically a bully! 😂😂
[01/01/2021, 17:23:50] Mr G: My 2021
[01/01/2021, 17:23:52] Mr G: So far

[01/01/2021, 19:59:12] Mr G: 🤣
[01/01/2021, 19:59:19] Mr G: I accept that faith
[01/01/2021, 19:59:23] Mr G: fate*
[01/01/2021, 19:59:46] Sam: What’s your favourite cake?
[01/01/2021, 20:00:29] Mr G: Biscuit cake

[01/01/2021, 20:02:32] Mr G: Yeah, it’s portuguese apparently
[01/01/2021, 20:02:39] Mr G: It’s amazing
[01/01/2021, 20:03:01] Sam: I was hoping you’d say carrot cake
[01/01/2021, 20:03:10] Sam: 😬
[01/01/2021, 20:03:23] Mr G: 😂
[02/01/2021, 11:11:26] Mr G: Hey !
[02/01/2021, 11:11:37] Mr G: Are you still not seeing many people ?
[02/01/2021, 11:20:04] Sam: Yeah
[02/01/2021, 11:20:19] Sam: If there’s a chance I can go see my grandad, I want to be able to take it
[02/01/2021, 11:20:36] Sam: And my lil nanna is still staying with us so I can’t risk it
[02/01/2021, 11:33:48] Mr G: Ah fair
[02/01/2021, 11:34:45] Mr G: I thought so. the few of us are having dinner at Niddy’s tonight
[02/01/2021, 11:35:14] Mr G: Not sure how many we will be but probably too many for that
[02/01/2021, 11:37:30] Sam: Give everyone a big happy new year squeeze from me 🤗❤️

[03/01/2021, 21:32:19] Sam: Me too
[03/01/2021, 21:32:28] Sam: They must have broke up
[03/01/2021, 21:32:33] Sam: ☹️
[03/01/2021, 21:32:40] Sam: Gary ain’t no player
[03/01/2021, 21:33:05] Mr G: Back in portugal a friend’s girlfriend asked him to install tinder so they can...experiment
[03/01/2021, 21:33:15] Sam: Absolute husband goals
[03/01/2021, 21:33:14] Mr G: So I expect everything at this point
[03/01/2021, 21:33:19] Sam: What?!
[03/01/2021, 21:33:19] Mr G: 😂
[03/01/2021, 21:33:39] Mr G: Ahah
[03/01/2021, 21:33:50] Sam: That girlfriend clearly wants to be single and just doesn’t know how to tell him 🙄
[03/01/2021, 21:33:58] Mr G: I like him, my man perspective is good
[03/01/2021, 21:34:05] Mr G: Nah
[03/01/2021, 21:34:10] Mr G: But I don’t think it will work
[03/01/2021, 21:34:17] Sam: Just your woman radar that’s whack 😂
[03/01/2021, 21:34:36] Sam: Oh like 3somes?
[03/01/2021, 21:35:29] Mr G: Yes
[03/01/2021, 21:35:51] Sam: Ah there’s quite a few couples looking for that here too
[03/01/2021, 21:35:57] Mr G: Yeah
[03/01/2021, 21:35:59] Mr G: Wait
[03/01/2021, 21:36:12] Mr G: That reminds me

[03/01/2021, 21:37:04] Sam: Try it, you might like it
[03/01/2021, 21:37:08] Sam: 😉
[03/01/2021, 21:37:13] Mr G: Yes who knows
[03/01/2021, 21:37:43] Mr G: If there’s no eye contact it’s not gay
[03/01/2021, 21:37:56] Sam: Exactly 🤷🏼‍♀️
[03/01/2021, 21:39:49] Sam: Should I tell Gary I saw him on tinder?
[03/01/2021, 21:39:56] Mr G: Hmmm
[03/01/2021, 21:40:01] Mr G: Why would you?
[03/01/2021, 21:40:20] Sam: I guess he didn’t say if he’d seen me
[03/01/2021, 21:40:31] Sam: Just funny when you see someone you know 😂
[03/01/2021, 21:40:54] Sam: And I know he likes me
[03/01/2021, 21:40:55] Mr G: Ahah I know
[03/01/2021, 21:41:23] Sam: Maybe swipe and pretend I never saw it... ignorance is bliss once again 😂
[03/01/2021, 21:41:31] Mr G: I’ve seen a few since I installed, and my initial reaction is to send a screenshot for banter, but then I think it’s always a bit awkward
[03/01/2021, 21:41:37] Mr G: So I just let it be
[03/01/2021, 21:41:52] Sam: You bantered me
[03/01/2021, 21:42:04] Mr G: Only like 2 months after
[03/01/2021, 21:42:37] Mr G: I didn’t send you a screenshot
[03/01/2021, 21:42:40] Sam: We’ve passed the awkward stage anyway
[03/01/2021, 21:42:44] Sam: 😂
[03/01/2021, 21:43:15] Sam: Literally died of awkwardness and got resurrected 😂

[04/01/2021, 09:09:42] Mr G: Yeah, had the same feeling when I found mine back in the office the other day
[04/01/2021, 09:21:57] Sam: He looks a little too comfortable to be honest... I did my makeup and hair all nice for first day back and he’s grabbing all the attention instead
[04/01/2021, 09:31:24] Mr G: Ahah is he ?
[04/01/2021, 09:31:59] Mr G: I just realised that Thursday is named after the Norse god Thor. Thor’s day
[04/01/2021, 09:32:19] Mr G: 🤯
[04/01/2021, 09:37:21] Sam: Yeah but he’s got the force, so I can’t really compete with that. I’m but a mere mortal woman 🤷🏼‍♀️
[04/01/2021, 09:37:39] Sam: So who is FriYay named after?

[04/01/2021, 09:40:14] Mr G: Wife of Odin (Woden - Wednesday)
[04/01/2021, 09:42:04] Sam: Reddit facts?
[04/01/2021, 09:42:38] Sam: Frigga is such a good name!
[04/01/2021, 09:42:49] Sam: Nobody would dare mess with a Frigga
[04/01/2021, 09:44:12] Mr G: I think so

[04/01/2021, 18:07:05] Sam: I think so 😂 I was going to see if you wanted a bubble buddy to work from home with this week 👨🏽‍💻👩🏼‍💻 but looks like that idea is going to be out the window
[04/01/2021, 18:08:13] Mr G: 🤷🏻‍♂️
[04/01/2021, 18:10:49] Sam: I’m keeping fingers crossed for furlough
[04/01/2021, 18:11:00] Sam: I’ve got a bathroom suite to fit 😂
[04/01/2021, 18:11:38] Mr G: Redundancy for me 🤞

[04/01/2021, 19:35:16] Mr G: Right!!
[04/01/2021, 20:29:32] Sam: So it’s just the kids that can’t go to school?

[05/01/2021, 17:00:23] Mr G: Do you have any chance to visit him soon given the new rules ?
[05/01/2021, 17:09:07] Sam: I knew I’d wear you down eventually 😘
[05/01/2021, 17:12:17] Sam: He’s getting there, still hallucinating because of the infection, but he’s been coming out with some really funny things. Apparently he’s been seeing me around the hospital a lot (because I’m a doctor as well as an engineer) and apparently I’ve been looking after him, which is very sweet. 
He had a good night last night, so hopefully it will be better news when we talk to him tonight and the antibiotics are kicking in
[05/01/2021, 17:13:06] Sam: No chance at the moment, but we dropped off sweets and biscuits so he’s very popular on the ward 😂
[05/01/2021, 17:13:17] Sam: I just want him home so much
[05/01/2021, 17:13:51] Sam: I don’t think there’s ever ever ever going to be a day I’ll be ready to say goodbye to my grandad, so he just needs to live forever
[05/01/2021, 17:14:39] Mr G: 😔

[05/01/2021, 21:29:35] Mr G: Great!! 😊😊
[06/01/2021, 11:35:19] Sam: I don’t recommend working from home when you share a house with a mum, a nanna, a brother and grumpy dog 😂
[06/01/2021, 11:35:56] Sam: On the plus side, my team got to meet my tiny nanna and now they know who bakes all their cakes 👵🏼
[06/01/2021, 12:47:49] Mr G: Ahaha aw and what did they think of her?
[06/01/2021, 12:48:23] Mr G: I can imagine!but you will miss them when they leave
[06/01/2021, 18:30:57] Mr G: Do you know any good salsa online classes ?
[06/01/2021, 18:39:33] Sam: Solo or couple?

[08/01/2021, 21:51:21] Sam: Also.... italics 😳
[08/01/2021, 21:51:23] Mr G: 😀
[08/01/2021, 21:51:40] Mr G: Did you understand my question? 😂
[08/01/2021, 21:52:25] Sam: Oh I thought you meant why do you re-watch a movie you’ve already seen
[08/01/2021, 21:52:32] Sam: 😂
[08/01/2021, 21:52:45] Sam: Then I just started thinking about Ryan gosling 🥰
[08/01/2021, 21:53:36] Mr G: Your Hollywood crush stars alongside my Hollywood crush
[08/01/2021, 21:53:58] Sam: Eva mendes?

[08/01/2021, 21:55:28] Sam: Ooooooffff
[08/01/2021, 21:55:49] Sam: I’ve never seen it though
[08/01/2021, 21:56:02] Mr G: It’s nice! Have you seen the first one?
[08/01/2021, 21:56:10] Sam: I don’t think so
[08/01/2021, 21:56:19] Mr G: Aw see what I meant? Why is it “have seen” in the past
[08/01/2021, 21:56:24] Mr G: And watch in the present
[08/01/2021, 21:56:27] Mr G: WHY
[08/01/2021, 21:57:00] Sam: I see now I’ve looked past the gosling
[08/01/2021, 21:57:20] Sam: You have too much time on your hands bro 😂 do some python 😛
[08/01/2021, 21:57:59] Mr G: I’m actually on it now 😂
[08/01/2021, 21:58:21] Mr G: But really I legit want to know
[08/01/2021, 22:08:05] Mr G: I’m loving the python course. It’s a bit draining having to do it everyday after work
[08/01/2021, 22:08:41] Mr G: But it’s very interesting. It’s diving right into web development.
[08/01/2021, 22:08:57] Mr G: How’s your uni going overall?
[08/01/2021, 22:29:14] Sam: It’s good, it’s nice having a heads-up about what’s coming next (big data) so I can swot up and don’t have to feel like an idiot for once 😂
[08/01/2021, 22:29:51] Sam: It’s also 100% stuff I can apply at work, so it’s a win win
[08/01/2021, 22:32:18] Sam: Oh I forgot to tell you... I have to present in a video at work 😂
[08/01/2021, 22:32:46] Sam: That’s going to be seen by all the main manufacturers in U.K. 😳
[08/01/2021, 22:35:44] Sam: 🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🎥👱🏻‍♀️🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗
[09/01/2021, 00:04:59] Mr G: 😂

[09/01/2021, 13:07:07] Sam: 1 vaccinated little nanna 👌🏼
[09/01/2021, 13:07:30] Sam: A video about our digital projects
[09/01/2021, 13:50:54] Mr G: 😁😁😁😁
[09/01/2021, 13:50:55] Mr G: Yesss
[09/01/2021, 13:51:09] Mr G: I’m curious what is the guidance for vaccinated people?
[09/01/2021, 13:51:15] Mr G: Regarding covid restrictions

[09/01/2021, 14:13:25] Sam: 😂😂😂
[09/01/2021, 14:13:56] Sam: Same as everyone else at the moment as people are only just starting to get the second jab
[09/01/2021, 14:14:29] Mr G: When is your nana due to the second one?
[09/01/2021, 14:14:31] Sam: But apparently you’re given a bit of immunity from the first one, so I already feel a lot better than my nanna isn’t totally vulnerable
[09/01/2021, 14:14:36] Sam: 21 days time
[09/01/2021, 14:14:45] Mr G: I read about that today
[09/01/2021, 14:15:12] Mr G: Considerable amount of immunity starts to develop at 10 days after the first jab
[09/01/2021, 14:15:14] Sam: It was so well organised 👍🏼 we had to go to gosforth racecourse
[09/01/2021, 14:15:21] Sam: ❤️❤️❤️
[09/01/2021, 14:15:35] Sam: When will your gran get it?
[09/01/2021, 14:15:58] Mr G: Don’t know. Chaos there
[09/01/2021, 14:16:05] Mr G: Have to check if everyone’s alive
[09/01/2021, 14:16:14] Mr G: Not sure the country has sunken
[09/01/2021, 21:12:27] Mr G: How’s your day been
[09/01/2021, 22:32:43] Sam: Aww it’s been lovely ❤️ My grandad sounded great on the phone today, so hopefully he’s getting out next week 🙌🏼 
Did some dance classes with zero knee pain, so all in all, a very nice day 😊 hows your day been?
[10/01/2021, 00:22:21] Mr G: Great :)
[10/01/2021, 00:22:37] Mr G: My knees ached a bit today
[10/01/2021, 00:22:46] Mr G: I guess I need to get them moving a bit more
[10/01/2021, 00:22:50] Mr G: Mostly coding

[10/01/2021, 15:49:40] Mr G: Where is that
[10/01/2021, 15:57:55] Sam: On the way to the Lake District
[10/01/2021, 15:58:40] Sam: There are so many BMW’s just abandoned by the side of the road 😂
[10/01/2021, 15:58:59] Mr G: Not equipped for the conditions? 😅
[10/01/2021, 15:59:18] Mr G: Have you seen that Madrid basically stopped due to the huge snowstorm?
[10/01/2021, 15:59:24] Mr G: They are simply not ready ahah
[10/01/2021, 15:59:32] Sam: I saw carlas story, it looks amazing!
[10/01/2021, 15:59:42] Mr G: They will have -13 on Tuesday. It’s unprecedented
[10/01/2021, 15:59:52] Sam: Whaaaaaaaat!!
[10/01/2021, 16:00:00] Mr G: It’s crazy
[10/01/2021, 16:00:28] Sam: If it’s snowing again next weekend, I’m taking my snowboard out 🤩
[10/01/2021, 16:00:40] Sam: We can dig out a sledge for you 😉
[10/01/2021, 16:00:47] Mr G: Let’s hope so
[10/01/2021, 16:00:55] Mr G: Teasing me like this 🥺
[10/01/2021, 16:01:57] Sam: I mean, I can lend you my brother snowboard but we need to look after those knees
[10/01/2021, 16:02:07] Sam: Sledging is awesome!
[10/01/2021, 17:35:39] Mr G: I really need to get back snowboarding
[10/01/2021, 17:35:44] Mr G: I honestly think I can
[10/01/2021, 17:35:55] Mr G: I just need to focus my recovery on that
[10/01/2021, 17:36:05] Mr G: This has been a shit year for recovery
[10/01/2021, 17:36:25] Mr G: The only real issue is an accident. My knees are very vulnerable again
[10/01/2021, 17:59:13] Sam: Well we could always have a day trip to the indoor snow slope in Leeds when it opens and test them out ☺️
[10/01/2021, 17:59:37] Mr G: Deal :) see you in 2023 then !
[10/01/2021, 18:01:14] Sam: 😳
[10/01/2021, 18:22:37] Sam: Guess that movie: “Nobody tosses a dwarf!”
[10/01/2021, 18:22:53] Mr G: LOTR
[10/01/2021, 18:23:52] Sam: I forgot it was like 3 hours long 🙈
[10/01/2021, 18:24:03] Mr G: What do I win?
[10/01/2021, 18:24:50] Mr G: Pff that’s the easy choice. You need to sit through the extended directors cut for 5 hours
[10/01/2021, 18:25:04] Mr G: 😂
[10/01/2021, 18:26:27] Sam: A tiny round of applause 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
[10/01/2021, 18:26:31] Sam: This exists???
[10/01/2021, 18:27:22] Mr G: Ahah yes
[10/01/2021, 18:27:34] Mr G: Not sure 5 hours long but it’s like 4
[10/01/2021, 18:28:05] Mr G: It’s crazy that everyone in middle earth has a British accent. Except Aragon
[10/01/2021, 18:28:10] Mr G: Crazy how nature works
[10/01/2021, 18:28:12] Mr G: 😂
[10/01/2021, 18:28:20] Sam: 😂😂😂😂😂
[10/01/2021, 18:29:21] Sam: Orlando bloom shoulda kept that hair 🧝🏼‍♂️✨
[10/01/2021, 18:49:06] Mr G: Ahah
[10/01/2021, 18:49:14] Mr G: That’s a very accurate emoji
[10/01/2021, 18:49:25] Mr G: Are you watching the first one ?
[10/01/2021, 18:51:30] Sam: Yes
[10/01/2021, 18:52:45] Sam: I haven’t seen this for yeeeeeeears
[10/01/2021, 19:04:31] Mr G: I don’t like house cleaning but damn it feels good when you finish
[10/01/2021, 19:05:00] Mr G: Like I deserve to use it again 😂
[10/01/2021, 19:05:26] Sam: I love cleaning 🤩
[10/01/2021, 19:05:47] Mr G: 🤔
[10/01/2021, 19:06:02] Mr G: 😏
[10/01/2021, 19:06:07] Sam: I always have 😂
[10/01/2021, 19:06:07] Mr G: 😀
[10/01/2021, 19:06:15] Mr G: We can work a deal here
[10/01/2021, 19:06:17] Mr G: Ahahah
[10/01/2021, 19:06:31] Sam: 🤔
[10/01/2021, 19:06:59] Mr G: I’ll let you clean my house, and in exchange you get to something you love 😀👉👉
[10/01/2021, 19:07:15] Sam: Hmmmmm

[11/01/2021, 09:33:40] Sam: I don’t 100% remember... but I know I’m mad at you 😂

[11/01/2021, 09:36:16] Sam: Me too
[11/01/2021, 09:36:44] Sam: Wanna go for a walk or something after work one day?
[11/01/2021, 09:36:53] Mr G: I think it’s too much time alone
[11/01/2021, 09:36:58] Mr G: Yes !
[11/01/2021, 09:37:09] Sam: At least I’ve got a nanna to keep me company
[11/01/2021, 09:37:12] Mr G: I’m entirely convinced I’m losing hair
[11/01/2021, 09:37:17] Sam: You have no nanna... only plants
[11/01/2021, 09:37:18] Mr G: But I don’t know
[11/01/2021, 09:37:22] Sam: 😂😂
[11/01/2021, 09:37:38] Mr G: Hey, they good companions !
[11/01/2021, 09:38:02] Sam: You have so much, you could lose half of it and nobody would notice 😂
[11/01/2021, 09:38:24] Mr G: I keep comparing myself to photos a few months old 😂
[11/01/2021, 09:38:39] Mr G: I can’t reach a conclusion but my hair feels thinner on the front 😂
[11/01/2021, 09:57:37] Sam: I think we’ve all just had waaaay too much time to stare at our own faces over lockdown. Cosmetic surgery is up about 100% 

I don’t think it is (or it’s definitely not noticeable) You still have a fine barnet Mr G 👌🏼💁🏻
[11/01/2021, 10:00:21] Mr G: Yeah definitely ! It’s not healthy having this much time in front of a mirror 😂
[11/01/2021, 10:00:38] Mr G: I don’t think it’s noticeable yet but I do feel that it will be eventually
[11/01/2021, 10:00:53] Mr G: But I also read that your hair sheds more during winter time
[11/01/2021, 10:07:04] Mr G: We are going to have elections at the end of the month
[11/01/2021, 10:07:04] Mr G: The only way to vote is to go to Manchester
[11/01/2021, 10:07:04] Mr G: In person
[11/01/2021, 10:07:08] Mr G: Makes no sense
[11/01/2021, 10:07:17] Mr G: In the middle of a pandemic
[11/01/2021, 10:07:56] Sam: I thought they were going to postpone them?
[11/01/2021, 10:08:13] Mr G: Whom?
[11/01/2021, 10:10:47] Sam: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/uk-government-has-delayed-elections-longer-than-most-countries-and-england-still-isnt-ready-to-hold-pandemic-votes-in-may-152862
[11/01/2021, 10:10:54] Sam: Bojo
[11/01/2021, 10:11:19] Mr G: I’m not a uk citizen 😂 I have no saying on those elections
[11/01/2021, 10:11:36] Mr G: I appreciate that you are counting on me haha
[11/01/2021, 10:11:39] Mr G: I send kudos
[11/01/2021, 10:12:09] Sam: I’m past caring. They’re all as bad as each other
[11/01/2021, 10:12:45] Mr G: Well at least they took the pandemic into consideration
[11/01/2021, 10:12:55] Mr G: Whereas my gov clearly doesn’t care
[11/01/2021, 10:13:00] Sam: Winston and Maggie would be turning in their graves at this imbecile
[11/01/2021, 10:13:05] Mr G: Making me go to Manchester
[11/01/2021, 10:13:17] Sam: Can’t you vote by post???
[11/01/2021, 10:13:23] Mr G: No it’s ridiculous
[11/01/2021, 10:13:34] Mr G: And the only days I can vote is tomorrow to Thursday
[11/01/2021, 10:13:43] Sam: But they’re literally gonna post your vote back to Portugal 😂
[11/01/2021, 10:13:44] Mr G: Which is super doable
[11/01/2021, 10:13:56] Sam: Can you vote by proxy and get a friend to do it?
[11/01/2021, 10:14:12] Sam: You can lend my car if it’s important to you?
[11/01/2021, 10:14:26] Mr G: Also I can only use my id , not the passport. Again makes a lot of sense since brexit. My id is expired
[11/01/2021, 10:14:39] Mr G: It’s not really
[11/01/2021, 10:14:46] Mr G: I’m not going to go for all this trouble
[11/01/2021, 10:14:51] Mr G: I send kudos to them 😂
[11/01/2021, 10:15:06] Mr G: The outcome will be a landslide anyway
[11/01/2021, 10:15:14] Sam: That’s frustrating they’re making it so difficult
[11/01/2021, 10:15:18] Mr G: But thanks
[11/01/2021, 10:15:25] Mr G: I just find it ridiculous
[11/01/2021, 10:15:35] Sam: Well if you change your mind, I’m not using it
‎[11/01/2021, 10:15:49] Mr G: ‎image omitted
[11/01/2021, 10:16:39] Mr G: And I wouldn’t be surprised if this is the only polling station in the country
[11/01/2021, 10:16:54] Sam: Travelling hundreds of miles in a pandemic, in winter, at short notice 🤦🏼‍♀️
[11/01/2021, 10:16:55] Mr G: Meaning people who live in London, Scotland or NI would have to go there
[11/01/2021, 10:17:13] Sam: Manchester is the middle of the country, so probably
[11/01/2021, 10:17:46] Sam: Surely NI have their own though. What are they gonna do, swim?? 😂
[11/01/2021, 10:18:14] Sam: You’d be PISSED in you were living in the Scottish highlands though
[11/01/2021, 10:18:19] Mr G: Well it’s water!! If you can swim why not !
[11/01/2021, 10:18:24] Mr G: 😂
[11/01/2021, 10:18:48] Sam: Guess then you’re fulfilling your national duty AND daily exercise regime in one fell swoop
[11/01/2021, 10:20:13] Mr G: Exactly haha
[11/01/2021, 10:20:32] Mr G: Oh god the queue on that polling station if it really is the only one available
[11/01/2021, 10:20:40] Mr G: I want to stay away from this 😂

[11/01/2021, 13:05:53] Mr G: Crazy
[11/01/2021, 13:05:58] Mr G: I’m melting
[11/01/2021, 13:06:05] Sam: 😂😂
[11/01/2021, 13:06:10] Mr G: At lunchtime ? Sounds good
[11/01/2021, 13:07:23] Sam: The heating is on so high here because of nanna, I literally can’t breathe in this house 🥵
[11/01/2021, 13:07:42] Sam: I think I have a meeting at 1 but can head along straight after

[11/01/2021, 13:46:13] Sam: I’ve been t-total since new year and not once have I craved an apple pie 🤷🏼‍♀️
[11/01/2021, 13:46:48] Mr G: what about your no alcohol decision ?
[11/01/2021, 13:47:14] Sam: I think I’m gonna stick with it for the foreseeable 👍🏼
[11/01/2021, 17:13:39] Sam: My grandad’s getting out tomorrow 🥳🙌🏼
[11/01/2021, 17:20:26] Mr G: 🥳
[11/01/2021, 17:20:28] Mr G: Great news
[11/01/2021, 17:20:34] Mr G: He’s feeling better I assume ?
[11/01/2021, 17:29:27] Sam: Yeah he is, he can’t wait to get back 😊 I’m going to miss having my little nanna here though
[11/01/2021, 17:33:38] Mr G: Haha is your brother still there too?
[11/01/2021, 17:33:49] Mr G: Did your grandad get vaccinated as well?
[11/01/2021, 18:06:09] Sam: No, my bro went last week so it’s just us girls 👱🏻‍♀️👩🏼‍🦳👵🏼 and Barney 🐶
He hasn’t had it yet, I think I’ll be taking him as soon as he gets out
[11/01/2021, 22:40:58] Mr G: Haha and you’ll be shielded by 2 imune grandparents !

[12/01/2021, 13:31:06] Sam: If I leave in 15 mins or so? Is that okay?
[12/01/2021, 13:31:13] Sam: Just finishing my meeting
[12/01/2021, 13:39:33] Mr G: Ok!
[12/01/2021, 13:39:43] Mr G: Let me know when you’re nearby
[12/01/2021, 13:39:49] Mr G: Where do you want to meet ?
[12/01/2021, 13:53:49] Sam: Meet you at yours? Leaving mine now 😊
[12/01/2021, 14:04:27] Mr G: Alright !
[12/01/2021, 14:09:49] Sam: Heeeeere
[12/01/2021, 14:10:12] Mr G: Going
[12/01/2021, 15:39:59] Sam: Feel all revived after that little vitamin D infusion ☺️✨☀️ thank you 😘
[12/01/2021, 15:40:12] Sam: Messaged Shaun, I’ll let you know if he messages me back
[12/01/2021, 15:40:51] Sam: Give Gary and Andre a big squeeze from me (from 2m away, of course)
[12/01/2021, 16:29:39] Mr G: ☺️ thanks for the company too
[12/01/2021, 16:29:49] Mr G: He actually texted as soon as I entered my place
[12/01/2021, 16:29:55] Mr G: I will!
[12/01/2021, 16:49:26] Sam: Shaun replied 👍🏼 he sounds okay
[12/01/2021, 17:50:12] Mr G: Great
[12/01/2021, 17:50:18] Mr G: Great lemon cake as well
[12/01/2021, 17:58:23] Sam: ☺️
[12/01/2021, 18:25:09] Sam: The little grandad is home 😌
[12/01/2021, 18:36:21] Mr G: 🥰
[12/01/2021, 21:01:20] Mr G: Do you think I’m really losing hair? Or am I just losing my mind? 😂 I look at photos months or even weeks old and I feel difference
[12/01/2021, 21:01:27] Mr G: I must be hallucinating
[12/01/2021, 21:01:32] Mr G: Sorry for the girl moment
[12/01/2021, 21:16:06] Sam: It looks exactly the same! 
Is it not just because it’s long? My hair always feels really thin till I get it cut, then it feels like I gained a million new strands 😂
[12/01/2021, 21:16:23] Mr G: Maybe 😂
[12/01/2021, 21:16:33] Mr G: I’m just spending too much time by myself
[12/01/2021, 21:17:24] Sam: Also, if your friends weren’t flapping about their hair, would you even be looking? I keep thinking I should get lip fillers because EVERYONE else is doing it but then I check myself and realise my lips are just fine and it’s just hype
[12/01/2021, 21:19:57] Sam: Instead of fixating on it, get yo’self a woman who can run her hands through it and distract yourself instead 😉
[12/01/2021, 21:20:05] Sam: Oh and get a haircut 😋
[12/01/2021, 21:20:31] Mr G: Maybe...it makes sense. You definitely don’t need any lip fillers 😂
[12/01/2021, 21:20:51] Sam: Right?! It’s the peer pressure! 😂
[12/01/2021, 21:21:00] Sam: 💋
[12/01/2021, 21:21:02] Mr G: I really need one
[12/01/2021, 21:21:12] Mr G: But I don’t think I’ll get any til March
[12/01/2021, 21:21:23] Mr G: Also, my last haircut was a disaster
[12/01/2021, 21:21:27] Sam: Surely we know someone who can cut hair?
[12/01/2021, 21:21:40] Sam: Shaun was in the military, he must be able to?
[12/01/2021, 21:21:58] Sam: I used to cut the lads offshore but only a short back and sides 😂
[12/01/2021, 21:22:12] Sam: Even then it was only when nobody would see them for a month 😂
[12/01/2021, 21:23:15] Sam: You have lovely hair by the way. I’ve told you this before, but just incase you needed to hear it today 😊
[12/01/2021, 21:24:05] Sam: And you’re very beautiful on the inside, which Is the most important!
[12/01/2021, 21:25:57] Mr G: Well I’m not ready to have my head fully shaved😅
[12/01/2021, 21:26:37] Mr G: Aw 🥺🥺 I was not ready for this now
[12/01/2021, 21:27:00] Mr G: Thank you 🥰 you too!
[12/01/2021, 21:27:12] Mr G: But it’s fate, men lose their hair

[12/01/2021, 22:25:50] Sam: Were you aware of Microsoft teams “together mode”...?
[12/01/2021, 22:54:56] Mr G: No what is that ? 😅
[13/01/2021, 12:52:00] Mr G: Soooo
[13/01/2021, 12:53:19] Mr G: Voting is forbidden by mail anywhere in the world for these elections, the Portuguese gov has stated
[13/01/2021, 12:53:52] Mr G: New Zealand consulate is in Sidney, Vietnam consulate is in Thailand 😂
[13/01/2021, 12:53:59] Mr G: I’m not the worst case
[13/01/2021, 14:48:55] Sam: Is there a political agenda for making it hard for people to vote or something?!
[13/01/2021, 17:51:02] Mr G: aparently
[13/01/2021, 20:31:46] Sam: So my friend called me today... she’s getting tests done because they think she’s got thyroid cancer 😳
[13/01/2021, 22:05:20] Mr G: oh no :/ who's this friend?
[13/01/2021, 22:05:24] Mr G: that sucks...
[13/01/2021, 23:10:09] Sam: My old flatmate from Aberdeen. Her mum died of cancer when we were living together, so it’s totally hit her like a brick and she’s absolutely terrified ☹️ they said it could be up to 2 weeks before they get results of her biopsy because of covid 😢
[13/01/2021, 23:10:53] Sam: I’ve just made 7 lasagnes to take my mind off it 🙈
[14/01/2021, 10:53:41] Mr G: Damn that’s an awful situation. I hope it’s nothing of that sort!
[14/01/2021, 10:54:05] Mr G: Is she our age ?

[14/01/2021, 11:10:12] Sam: The scar is horrific... you look like Frankenstein
[14/01/2021, 11:11:24] Sam: This reminds me of someone........ 😂😂
[14/01/2021, 11:11:44] Mr G: Horrible... I didn’t know it was that common on young people

[14/01/2021, 13:40:26] Sam: I’ve had 2 adverts pop up for life insurance aimed at young women today 😐
[14/01/2021, 13:40:57] Mr G: Are we ever going to have those photos btw? 😅
[14/01/2021, 13:40:59] Sam: One is called DEADHAPPY
[14/01/2021, 13:41:07] Mr G: Wtf
[14/01/2021, 13:41:17] Sam: I messaged maz yesterday, he said he’s on it
[14/01/2021, 13:41:31] Sam: It’s actually pretty cool, I might invest 😂
‎[14/01/2021, 13:41:43] Mr G: ‎sticker omitted
[14/01/2021, 13:42:14] Sam: You can buy insurance that pays out for crazy things if you die. Like for all your mates to go on holiday or get a tattoo of your face 😂
[14/01/2021, 13:42:47] Sam: Or buy a loved one a puppy to replace you 😏
[14/01/2021, 13:43:05] Mr G: What the actual fuck 😂
[14/01/2021, 13:43:18] Mr G: That’s awesome though

[14/01/2021, 13:46:16] Mr G: And their page is memes 😂
[14/01/2021, 13:46:25] Mr G: Is this a normal concept?
[14/01/2021, 13:46:40] Sam: Nope, that’s why I love it!
[14/01/2021, 13:47:08] Mr G: I can see why slavery was so popular a few centuries ago. I m so not in the mood to wash my dishes
[14/01/2021, 13:47:16] Sam: People are weird about death (understandably) but I think covid has more people discussing it now
[14/01/2021, 13:47:23] Sam: You’re bad
[14/01/2021, 13:48:17] Mr G: Can you imagine being born into a slaver family. And yeah actually you care about human rights and abolishing and everything. But can you just...please wash my dishes one more time 😂
[14/01/2021, 13:50:22] Mr G: I know
[14/01/2021, 13:50:43] Mr G: I don’t know what to think about the page 😂
[14/01/2021, 13:51:12] Sam: Take a wife 🤷🏼‍♀️
[14/01/2021, 13:51:44] Mr G: We’re still a century away from progress but it’s progress nonetheless
[14/01/2021, 14:12:13] Sam: Okay, so for my deathwish, I’m buying my mum an alpaca farm, sending my brother on holiday and paying for my own funeral. That’s got to guarantee entry to heaven, right??
[14/01/2021, 14:12:39] Mr G: Close
[14/01/2021, 14:12:55] Mr G: But your friends get nothing
[14/01/2021, 14:13:22] Mr G: God requires a bit more
[14/01/2021, 15:31:06] Sam: I was thinking of leaving you some sort of quest
[14/01/2021, 15:31:21] Sam: But then I figured I’d come back as a ghost and just haunt you instead
[14/01/2021, 17:34:38] Mr G: I can deal with that
[14/01/2021, 17:38:11] Mr G: At Nuffield now
[14/01/2021, 17:38:21] Mr G: Feels like I’m dreaming
[14/01/2021, 17:40:05] Sam: Finally!!!!!!
[14/01/2021, 17:40:16] Sam: Is it empty?
[14/01/2021, 17:40:27] Mr G: It seemed, most of it
[14/01/2021, 17:40:39] Sam: I’m baking. I’ve gone full nanna-mode
[14/01/2021, 17:40:39] Mr G: But the out patient area is fairly busy

[14/01/2021, 17:41:44] Sam: That too ☺️
[14/01/2021, 17:41:58] Sam: It’s an orange and sultana cake

[14/01/2021, 17:43:28] Sam: Is it the really posh eccentric woman on reception?
[14/01/2021, 17:43:46] Mr G: Hmmm
[14/01/2021, 17:43:52] Mr G: Well there were 2 receptions
[14/01/2021, 17:43:58] Mr G: Didn’t get any posh eccentric vibe from either
[14/01/2021, 17:44:01] Sam: Upstairs one
[14/01/2021, 17:44:11] Sam: Oh you’d KNOW
[14/01/2021, 17:44:11] Mr G: Doesn’t seem like it
[14/01/2021, 17:44:14] Mr G: Hahaha
[14/01/2021, 17:44:16] Mr G: Then no
[14/01/2021, 17:44:31] Mr G: This one has a thick geordie accent and is lovely
[14/01/2021, 17:45:43] Mr G: She has eyes of a colour like I’ve never seen before
[14/01/2021, 17:46:55] Sam: Like a vampire??
[14/01/2021, 17:47:13] Mr G: Hmm wouldn’t say so
[14/01/2021, 17:47:15] Mr G: Maybe
[14/01/2021, 17:48:03] Mr G: This golden green ish Crystal clear eyes
[14/01/2021, 17:48:13] Mr G: Ok so the doctor appears to be super late
[14/01/2021, 17:48:16] Mr G: Great

[14/01/2021, 18:57:20] Mr G: Not sure
[14/01/2021, 18:57:29] Mr G: Forgot to ask that

[14/01/2021, 21:09:22] Sam: Oh... and that little trip to the Lake District....

Dry January voided

[15/01/2021, 09:13:12] Sam: I just tried to leave someone a voicemail but I still have the sleepy voice
[15/01/2021, 10:07:16] Mr G: Haha
[15/01/2021, 10:07:30] Mr G: Yeah my voice is unused as well
[15/01/2021, 15:16:55] Sam: So I applied for that flu trial
[15/01/2021, 15:17:21] Sam: And they called me and asked if I’d go to London to get screened to see if I’m suitable 😂
[15/01/2021, 15:17:43] Sam: It’s a trial for the common cold
[15/01/2021, 15:17:45] Mr G: Alright, have you contacted dead happy already?
[15/01/2021, 15:17:51] Sam: 😂😂😂

[15/01/2021, 15:18:21] Mr G: Alright
[15/01/2021, 15:18:28] Mr G: Have they explained you everything it entails?
[15/01/2021, 15:18:35] Sam: Yeah
[15/01/2021, 15:19:00] Sam: Daily blood tests, deep throating a cotton bud and being locked in a room for 2 weeks
[15/01/2021, 15:19:38] Sam: You can’t do it if you’ve suffered from depression though... and I might have bent the truth a little there....
[15/01/2021, 15:20:10] Mr G: But what are they going to give you?
[15/01/2021, 15:20:20] Sam: Think they’re worried you flip out in isolation
[15/01/2021, 15:20:38] Sam: They just expose you to the common cold
[15/01/2021, 15:20:50] Mr G: What?!
[15/01/2021, 15:20:52] Mr G: Really?
[15/01/2021, 15:20:55] Mr G: No drugs ?
[15/01/2021, 15:25:43] Sam: Yeah there’s medication but it’s already been tested on humans
[15/01/2021, 15:26:15] Mr G: Make sure you read everything before signing anything
[15/01/2021, 15:26:38] Sam: I don’t think I’m going to be able to do it anyway
[15/01/2021, 15:26:59] Sam: I had therapy and antidepressants for my sleepwalking which will probably exclude me
[15/01/2021, 15:32:01] Mr G: Yeah I imagine :/
[15/01/2021, 15:32:14] Mr G: Honestly, I don’t really think 4,2k is worth it
[15/01/2021, 15:32:29] Mr G: But then again I’m such a slut I would probably do it with enough convincing 😂
[15/01/2021, 15:33:15] Sam: We could drive down together 😁 London adventure roadtrip #2
[15/01/2021, 15:34:01] Mr G: London 2: Labrats
[15/01/2021, 15:34:17] Mr G: This time it’s personal
[15/01/2021, 15:34:23] Sam: 🤣🤣
[15/01/2021, 15:35:08] Sam: How did we go from partying and modelling to selling our bodies by the sequel??
[15/01/2021, 15:35:29] Sam: 2020 was a cruel mistress
[15/01/2021, 15:39:37] Mr G: Trueness
[15/01/2021, 16:20:55] Sam: I just checked my medical records online
[15/01/2021, 16:21:26] Sam: They’re all missing between 2010 and 2018. So I guess I’m good to go 😂
[15/01/2021, 16:22:19] Sam: Bit worrying that they’ve lost them though... 🤔
‎[15/01/2021, 17:12:12] Sam: ‎image omitted
[15/01/2021, 17:12:57] Sam: That annual leave holiday is looking less and less likely 😕
[15/01/2021, 17:13:17] Mr G: How come?
[15/01/2021, 17:13:26] Mr G: Yeah I’ve lost all hopes now
[15/01/2021, 17:13:47] Mr G: They banned the flights from Portugal yesterday so I cannot even go home
[15/01/2021, 17:14:15] Mr G: Although travel corridor just means you have to quarantine from everywhere. You can still go
[15/01/2021, 18:49:05] Sam: Shiiiiiit Amin has the ‘Rona
[15/01/2021, 18:49:25] Mr G: :/
[15/01/2021, 18:49:28] Mr G: Is he ok?
[15/01/2021, 18:50:14] Sam: Yeah he’s mild but his parents aren’t doing good
[15/01/2021, 19:21:59] Mr G: Hope they’ll get better :(
[15/01/2021, 19:22:01] Mr G: All of them
[15/01/2021, 21:36:42] Sam: Have you ever seen a baby beaver?
[15/01/2021, 21:37:07] Sam: Literally the cutest baby animal ever
[15/01/2021, 23:14:51] Mr G: No 😂
[15/01/2021, 23:14:57] Mr G: Please show
[15/01/2021, 23:17:01] Sam: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eBgr32jL0Do
[15/01/2021, 23:17:58] Sam: His little teeth 😩
[15/01/2021, 23:18:12] Sam: And the squeaks!

[16/01/2021, 10:36:52] Sam: 🤣🤣🤣
[16/01/2021, 15:17:19] Sam: Honestly, the unrealistic beauty standards that Instagram is pushing on us at the moment
[16/01/2021, 15:17:22] Sam: I’m disgusted
‎[16/01/2021, 15:17:58] Sam: ‎video omitted
[16/01/2021, 15:18:39] Sam: And now seriously considering whatever surgery is required to make this a reality
[16/01/2021, 17:31:01] Mr G: 🤣
[16/01/2021, 17:31:10] Mr G: It took me a bit to realise you were joking
[16/01/2021, 17:31:41] Mr G: If you think instagram is bad then don’t even go to tik tok
[16/01/2021, 17:31:43] Mr G: 😂
‎[16/01/2021, 21:31:37] Sam: ‎image omitted
[16/01/2021, 21:31:50] Sam: Rasas doing free classes every weekend on YouTube
[16/01/2021, 21:32:06] Sam: The Dominican bachata from today is really good
[17/01/2021, 01:15:36] Mr G: Ohhh really? Did you take them?
[17/01/2021, 01:15:42] Mr G: Are they nice ?
[17/01/2021, 15:06:47] Sam: Yeah really nice! She’s doing two more today but I think it’s ladystyling. But definitely worth checking out next weekend if you’re free for an hour 😊
[17/01/2021, 15:07:16] Sam: She’s just full of infectious positivity
[17/01/2021, 15:27:13] Mr G: Infectious positivity 😬 🦠
[17/01/2021, 15:48:45] Sam: What about a day trip somewhere next weekend? A sneaky sneaky one, obviously 👮🏼🥸🥸
[17/01/2021, 15:51:11] Mr G: It’s an idea! Where?
[17/01/2021, 15:51:33] Mr G: Would you be up for a sneaky dance class session too 😬 with like 3 couples
[17/01/2021, 15:51:40] Mr G: We were discussing that yesterday
[17/01/2021, 15:51:50] Sam: Anywhere... Kielder? Bamburgh?
[17/01/2021, 15:52:05] Sam: Yeah after Friday (when grandad gets his jab)
[17/01/2021, 15:52:11] Sam: Who’s doing it?
[17/01/2021, 19:15:59] Mr G: Yeah I don’t know any of them  but sure
[17/01/2021, 19:16:18] Mr G: Well we thought about rezi, but that would mean a bit more people than I would feel comfortable having
[17/01/2021, 19:16:28] Mr G: So me 😂 and you and Vicky
[17/01/2021, 19:16:40] Mr G: All the others are total beginners
[17/01/2021, 19:16:47] Sam: 😂😂 well played
[17/01/2021, 19:17:20] Sam: Actually, my dream scenario... 🤔😂
[17/01/2021, 19:17:41] Sam: Anyway! I’m working on blagging is a trip to Dubai
[17/01/2021, 19:19:24] Sam: I might have to join a harem, but my Dubai sugar daddy is very keen to get us on a plane ASAP 😂
[17/01/2021, 19:26:24] Mr G: 😆
[17/01/2021, 19:26:35] Mr G: It’s a deal then
[17/01/2021, 19:26:37] Mr G: Both things
[17/01/2021, 19:31:25] Mr G: I have a friend there
[17/01/2021, 19:31:36] Mr G: I’m not sure if he’s still alive. He lived FAST
[17/01/2021, 19:32:22] Mr G: He totalled his car on a roundabout doing like 70. Fell asleep on the wheel 😂
[17/01/2021, 19:36:04] Sam: 😳
[17/01/2021, 19:36:37] Mr G: Crazy guy
[17/01/2021, 19:36:52] Mr G: I stopped over for a day and though I would get some rest
[17/01/2021, 19:36:55] Mr G: I was wrong
[17/01/2021, 19:37:33] Sam: 😂😂 I was too scared I was going to fuck up and get stoned to death or something, it was hard to relax 😅
[17/01/2021, 19:37:33] Mr G: He works in finance. Very corporate dude, has a flask of LSD in his bedroom 😂
[17/01/2021, 19:37:52] Sam: Where do you find these friends?!? 😂😂
[17/01/2021, 19:38:05] Mr G: There? I got the vibe that it’s a relatively open minded place
[17/01/2021, 19:38:08] Mr G: At least for tourists
[17/01/2021, 19:38:17] Mr G: Engineering uni
[17/01/2021, 19:38:24] Mr G: Lots of crazy people lol
[17/01/2021, 19:38:37] Mr G: He was not engineering though, friends of friends
[17/01/2021, 19:38:44] Sam: Balal and kotryna are out there at the mo I think
[17/01/2021, 19:38:50] Mr G: Yes
[17/01/2021, 19:39:20] Sam: They’re probably a safer option than LSD guy and sugar daddy Mohammed
[17/01/2021, 19:39:24] Sam: 😂
[17/01/2021, 19:39:30] Mr G: Ahahah
[17/01/2021, 19:39:33] Mr G: Yeah
[17/01/2021, 19:40:05] Mr G: I don’t know them that well though
[17/01/2021, 19:40:28] Mr G: LSD guy was super nice though. He gave me a bed and showed me around. I would have a boring time there by myself
[17/01/2021, 19:41:02] Mr G: And he introduced me to this guy who owns a desert safari gig and would have taken me if I stayed another day... sad

[18/01/2021, 10:36:42] Mr G: happy blue monday, of the bluest january
[18/01/2021, 10:37:03] Sam: Happy blue Monday! I’m feeling surprisingly upbeat for the most dismal day of the year
[18/01/2021, 10:37:07] Sam: And I’m in the office!
[18/01/2021, 10:37:13] Sam: It’s this guy

[18/01/2021, 10:37:34] Sam: Look at that wee face man
[18/01/2021, 10:37:33] Mr G: look at that cutie
[18/01/2021, 10:37:49] Sam: Just want to squeeze his likkle face
[18/01/2021, 10:38:12] Sam: How’s your positivity levels on a scale of 1-10?
[18/01/2021, 10:39:38] Mr G: solid 6
[18/01/2021, 10:39:39] Mr G: not bad
[18/01/2021, 10:42:21] Mr G: who told me Nissan sunderland factory outputs 400 vehicles per day?
[18/01/2021, 10:44:08] Sam: Not me
[18/01/2021, 10:44:13] Sam: Because we don’t
[18/01/2021, 10:44:19] Mr G: hmm
[18/01/2021, 10:44:26] Mr G: is it close?
[18/01/2021, 10:44:31] Sam: No
[18/01/2021, 10:44:34] Sam: 😂
[18/01/2021, 10:44:38] Mr G: haha
[18/01/2021, 10:44:41] Mr G: maybe per week?
[18/01/2021, 10:45:04] Sam: About 700 per day
[18/01/2021, 10:45:13] Mr G: LOL
[18/01/2021, 10:45:36] Mr G: ok so that one factory outputs 700 cars per day
[18/01/2021, 10:45:57] Mr G: why am I making an effort not to buy plastic wrapped stuff? 😆
[18/01/2021, 10:46:04] Sam: Yeah, almost 2 per minute
[18/01/2021, 10:46:17] Sam: We’re EXTREMELY efficient
[18/01/2021, 10:46:58] Sam: You should come for a visit when the world opens up again, it’s interesting 🤓
[18/01/2021, 10:47:22] Sam: Because you’re a good person who cares about sea turtles
[18/01/2021, 10:48:17] Mr G: I would really be interested actually
[18/01/2021, 10:48:27] Mr G: sounds like something I would be fascinated really
[18/01/2021, 10:48:41] Sam: Come visit our baby yoda
[18/01/2021, 10:48:53] Mr G: yeah but what impact am I making? compared to an industry, let alone several industries
[18/01/2021, 10:49:08] Sam: If everyone thought like that, we’d never get anywhere
[18/01/2021, 10:49:23] Sam: Millions of tiny changes make a huge difference
[18/01/2021, 10:49:40] Mr G: that's very nice but doesnt answer the question 😆
[18/01/2021, 10:49:52] Mr G: also I still do my part
[18/01/2021, 10:50:11] Mr G: just pointing the fact that the core of the problem is not on the single person
[18/01/2021, 10:50:25] Sam: My whole last project was about reducing energy consumption. By giving people tools to shut down equipment remotely, we saved 1 million in wasted energy in 1 MONTH.
[18/01/2021, 10:51:18] Sam: Basically each person switching off the lights and heating before they went home. Individual tiny changes 👌🏼
[18/01/2021, 10:51:20] Mr G: yes but 700 cars per day by one factory. are there other 700 cars on the opposite end going to waste?
[18/01/2021, 10:51:42] Mr G: Im sure you're being efficient and sustainable
[18/01/2021, 10:52:15] Sam: No, but the population is increasing and countries are developing to own cars where people didn’t own cars before
[18/01/2021, 10:52:44] Sam: Most households used to have one car if they were lucky, now they have 2 or 3
[18/01/2021, 10:53:00] Mr G: that's a problem
[18/01/2021, 10:53:16] Sam: Eventually we’ll share though. So cars won’t sit idle on a driveway
[18/01/2021, 10:54:09] Sam: We don’t all need cars at the same time, so you’ll effectively hire a car whilst you need it
[18/01/2021, 10:54:20] Mr G: yes!!
[18/01/2021, 10:54:28] Mr G: do yu believe thats the future?
[18/01/2021, 10:54:33] Mr G: cloud sharing
[18/01/2021, 10:54:40] Sam: Definitely
[18/01/2021, 10:54:40] Mr G: cloud everuythign
[18/01/2021, 10:54:40] Mr G: everything
[18/01/2021, 10:54:57] Sam: We won’t have clutter, everything will be on demand in the future
[18/01/2021, 10:55:57] Mr G: you know Im not much of a gamer. but google launched this cloud gaming platform Stadia. basically you stream games, you 'rent' a maxed out gaming rig, and play games remotely. the quality is almost unbelievable, if I were a gamer I would never buy a PC again
[18/01/2021, 10:56:20] Mr G: I tried it they are having a 3 month trial
[18/01/2021, 10:56:31] Mr G: it really shows how cloud and sharing will be the future
[18/01/2021, 10:56:41] Mr G: I think this is transversal to all industries
[18/01/2021, 10:56:45] Sam: I can’t do this, I get addicted to gaming
[18/01/2021, 10:56:48] Mr G: my dad doesnt like it though
[18/01/2021, 10:56:48] Mr G: xD
[18/01/2021, 10:56:51] Sam: It’s like crack for me
[18/01/2021, 10:57:10] Mr G: hhaha same, but I came up with mechanisms to cope with that
[18/01/2021, 10:57:12] Sam: My mum doesn’t either, that’s how you know it’s the future 😂
[18/01/2021, 10:57:28] Mr G: its horrible because you can play on your mac, you can play on your work laptop, even on your phone
[18/01/2021, 10:57:35] Mr G: and the quality is the same
[18/01/2021, 10:57:42] Sam: Nooooo shhhhhhhhhh
[18/01/2021, 10:57:42] Mr G: you just need good internet
[18/01/2021, 10:57:47] Sam: Noooooooo
[18/01/2021, 10:57:57] Sam: I just started playing Pokémon again
[18/01/2021, 10:58:05] Mr G: haha
[18/01/2021, 10:58:07] Mr G: which one?
[18/01/2021, 10:58:08] Sam: I was up till 1am 🙄
[18/01/2021, 10:58:14] Sam: Just on my phone
[18/01/2021, 10:58:19] Sam: The app thingy
[18/01/2021, 10:58:29] Mr G: haha no you have to go deeper
[18/01/2021, 10:58:32] Sam: It’s replaced “among us”
[18/01/2021, 10:58:35] Sam: I can’t!!
[18/01/2021, 10:58:36] Mr G: and get the rpg ones for nintendo switch
[18/01/2021, 10:58:39] Sam: I know myself
[18/01/2021, 10:58:42] Sam: I’d get in deep
[18/01/2021, 10:59:04] Sam: I’d be that girl who dies in her gaming chair from starvation

[18/01/2021, 10:59:26] Mr G: the same
[18/01/2021, 10:59:39] Mr G: I stopped playing games on my first year of uni
[18/01/2021, 10:59:48] Mr G: after I spent more than 24 hours playing Oblivion
[18/01/2021, 11:00:01] Mr G: no sleep, eating crap
[18/01/2021, 11:01:17] Mr G: not actual crap, I was not that bad 😆
[18/01/2021, 11:21:42] Sam: I had a friend who had a Super Nintendo when I was like 8. It was like that scene with bilbo baggins where they try to take the ring off him
[18/01/2021, 11:37:28] Mr G: ahahah
[18/01/2021, 11:37:29] Mr G: fair
[18/01/2021, 11:37:39] Mr G: gaming is dangerous then
[18/01/2021, 11:37:45] Mr G: Im buying an exercise bike
[18/01/2021, 11:38:50] Sam: Why? It’s practically spring!
[18/01/2021, 11:39:06] Sam: I got a turbo trainer and used it twice 😂
[18/01/2021, 11:39:39] Mr G: 😂 that’s not true
[18/01/2021, 11:40:12] Mr G: Regardless, it’s too cold until April
[18/01/2021, 11:40:17] Sam: Okay so 2 months
[18/01/2021, 11:40:25] Sam: But last year was freakishly early
[18/01/2021, 11:40:41] Sam: End of March was roasting!
[18/01/2021, 11:40:55] Mr G: Yeah but this winter seems to be colder
[18/01/2021, 11:40:57] Mr G: Anyway
[18/01/2021, 11:41:14] Mr G: I can’t maintain a proper exercise routine with the bike
[18/01/2021, 11:41:30] Mr G: I need an indoors one for that

[18/01/2021, 13:34:00] Sam: Oh god, I had a nightmare with imperials working offshore with Americans
[18/01/2021, 13:34:29] Sam: They delivered a load of risers for an oil rig I was installing in feet instead of metres
[18/01/2021, 13:34:33] Sam: 😂😂
[18/01/2021, 13:35:00] Sam: Queue some last-minute (not exactly to specification) welding on the back deck at midnight when everyone was asleep 😂
[18/01/2021, 13:36:02] Sam: There’s probably drainpipe and rubbish shoots and all sorts added onto the bottom of those risers to get them long enough 😂
[18/01/2021, 14:26:56] Mr G: That’s a very technical nightmare 😂
[18/01/2021, 14:27:43] Mr G: Do you think I could ask you for your help to pick up the exercise bike from decathlon? 😇🥺 I wasn’t expecting 25£ just for the delivery
[18/01/2021, 14:28:12] Mr G: We could use one of the 700/day cars produced in Nissan
[18/01/2021, 14:28:45] Sam: Yeah sure
[18/01/2021, 14:29:06] Sam: I’m surprised you got one, exercise bikes seem to have been sold out for months!
[18/01/2021, 14:29:19] Mr G: Me too tbh
[18/01/2021, 14:29:24] Mr G: Still too good to be true
[18/01/2021, 14:43:10] Sam: When do you want to go pick it up?
[18/01/2021, 14:43:25] Mr G: Maybe Friday ?
[18/01/2021, 14:43:55] Mr G: I have to go to Manchester on Thursday to renew my passport and ID card 😖
[18/01/2021, 14:47:53] Sam: I’m taking my grandad to get his injection after work but free after that if they’re open after 5?
[18/01/2021, 14:48:27] Mr G: Ok :)
[18/01/2021, 14:48:31] Mr G: Thank you!
[18/01/2021, 15:05:24] Sam: If we don’t make it, is Saturday morning okay?
[18/01/2021, 15:05:55] Sam: I just know my nanna will try and feed me when I drop my grandad off
[18/01/2021, 16:11:22] Mr G: Sure no worries
[18/01/2021, 16:11:49] Mr G: Haha that’s a very nana thing to do
[19/01/2021, 10:40:17] Sam: Furlough rumours at Nissan are spreading.... 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
[19/01/2021, 11:54:59] Sam: https://www.haysfaraway.co.uk/hotel-riu-naiboa
[19/01/2021, 12:47:42] Mr G: Sounds like a possibility 👀
[19/01/2021, 12:50:15] Sam: BA have some fab deals 😍
[19/01/2021, 12:55:53] Mr G: If the country has few to no restrictions the only real problem is getting tested before returning to the uk
[19/01/2021, 13:02:26] Sam: Apparently there are medics who go to the hotels and do them there
[19/01/2021, 13:04:13] Mr G: In DR?
[19/01/2021, 13:04:28] Mr G: Money is such a cool thing
[19/01/2021, 13:04:35] Mr G: It makes things happen
[19/01/2021, 13:04:37] Mr G: 😂
[19/01/2021, 13:05:42] Sam: Dec - April is the time to visit apparently
[19/01/2021, 14:37:55] Mr G: I was in DR covid guidance website
[19/01/2021, 14:39:03] Mr G: They are not requiring a test at the moment and they have a system in place for people to get tested there as you mentioned.
Apparently they have a curfew from 5pm atm effective until the 26th, so I suppose things would be a bit better in February. 
This is shaping to a very strong possibility
[19/01/2021, 14:39:11] Mr G: For me to spend all my annual leave
[19/01/2021, 14:39:54] Sam: I just downloaded the lonely planet guide
[19/01/2021, 14:40:46] Sam: I think if it looks unlikely before summer I’d still like to go in Nov/Dec. Rasa was talking about it the other day in her class saying it’s the best place she’s ever been
[19/01/2021, 14:41:38] Sam: Think of how good your Dominican bachata could be after a few weeks there! 🤩
[19/01/2021, 14:42:14] Sam: But will the U.K. government let you travel without a reason other than “holidayzzzz”
[19/01/2021, 14:45:17] Mr G: Yes
[19/01/2021, 14:45:24] Mr G: I went to portugal no questions asked
[19/01/2021, 14:45:30] Mr G: Me and a lot of brits
[19/01/2021, 14:46:11] Mr G: 2 times, the first time was also supposedly not allowed
[19/01/2021, 14:57:29] Mr G: I’ll wait till after the 26th to see how the restrictions will be. It’s going to be a looot of hassle and yes there’s a risk that something happens at the airport. Plus a lot of money
[19/01/2021, 14:57:58] Mr G: To see if it’s worth it.
[19/01/2021, 14:58:26] Sam: When’s the latest you can take your annual leave?
[19/01/2021, 14:59:05] Mr G: Middle of April
[19/01/2021, 14:59:21] Mr G: I need to be clear by the first of may
[19/01/2021, 14:59:22] Sam: You have to have taken it all by then?
[19/01/2021, 14:59:28] Sam: Ah okay
[19/01/2021, 14:59:38] Sam: Because there’s some fab little deals for April
[19/01/2021, 14:59:42] Sam: March is ££££
[19/01/2021, 14:59:57] Mr G: I can carry up to 5 days. But last year they changed that last minute and didn’t let us carry anything. Because they care about us.
[19/01/2021, 15:01:05] Sam: I’ve already identified the pool bar that I’d like to drink pina coladas until I pass out on
[19/01/2021, 15:01:19] Mr G: 😂😂😂
‎[19/01/2021, 15:01:23] Sam: ‎sticker omitted
[19/01/2021, 15:01:23] Mr G: That’s very important
[19/01/2021, 15:01:39] Mr G: You need to have that info prepared before you go in case boris ask you on the border
[19/01/2021, 15:01:48] Sam: I don’t want to be at work. I want to be drinking pina colada
[19/01/2021, 15:02:12] Mr G: Understandable

[19/01/2021, 17:10:33] Mr G: Did they also give you music during your MRI? 😂
[19/01/2021, 17:23:00] Sam: Yes! Have you just had it?
[19/01/2021, 17:23:04] Sam: How did it go?
[19/01/2021, 17:32:45] Mr G: went fine
[19/01/2021, 17:32:54] Mr G: They played some avicii
[19/01/2021, 17:33:00] Mr G: So they know what they’re doing
[19/01/2021, 17:46:55] Sam: It’s hard to keep still when you’re feel the music though
[19/01/2021, 17:46:59] Sam: I think I fell asleep
[19/01/2021, 17:58:07] Mr G: I was almost
[19/01/2021, 19:07:54] Sam: Reckon Joe exotic is going to get a pardon? 😂

[19/01/2021, 19:13:02] Sam: He hasn’t yet, but I hope it’s coming
[19/01/2021, 19:23:59] Mr G: have you ever watched trailer park boys?
[19/01/2021, 19:34:34] Sam: Nope
[19/01/2021, 19:34:37] Sam: Is it good?
[19/01/2021, 19:34:56] Mr G: it's a masterpiece
[19/01/2021, 19:35:21] Mr G: if you like cringy candid-documentary like comedy, like the office uk

[20/01/2021, 09:30:25] Sam: Have you done any stuff with AWS?
[20/01/2021, 10:24:16] Mr G: Nope
[20/01/2021, 10:24:17] Mr G: Why?
[20/01/2021, 10:37:14] Sam: We’re using it at work for our cloud based storage but there are AWS developer certificates you can do
[20/01/2021, 10:37:26] Sam: Just wondered if it was worth doing them
[20/01/2021, 10:38:01] Sam: We employ people to advise us on which AWS applications we need and they’re not cheap 😅
[20/01/2021, 10:40:59] Sam: Also I’m doing an AWS beginners course on Udemy and it’s fab. It explains things you should know but probably don’t (you might, I don’t) like what the numbers in an IP address mean and different storage systems 🤓
[20/01/2021, 10:43:11] Mr G: That sounds interesting
[20/01/2021, 10:43:17] Mr G: Yeah at some point I’ll need to learn it
[20/01/2021, 10:43:29] Mr G: Almost everything is stored in AWS these days
[20/01/2021, 10:44:38] Mr G: I had a friend working for AWS
[20/01/2021, 10:46:31] Sam: You have to sit an exam to get the certificates and it’s pretty tough I think
[20/01/2021, 10:47:09] Sam: Be a nice thing to study for oN A BEACH IN THE CARIBBEAN!

[25/01/2021, 21:27:15] Sam: Say hi from meee
[25/01/2021, 21:27:23] Sam: 😘😘😘
[25/01/2021, 21:31:17] Mr G: Ahah I will
[25/01/2021, 21:31:37] Mr G: I actually started the data science module (if you can call that) of that python 100 day challenge course
‎[25/01/2021, 22:10:58] Mr G: ‎sticker omitted
[25/01/2021, 22:31:34] Sam: I’m really trying with that course but her voice does my head in 😂

[25/01/2021, 22:32:14] Mr G: You dare insult Angela that way?!
[25/01/2021, 22:32:23] Mr G: No. No more fistbumps for you
[25/01/2021, 22:32:37] Sam: I know she’s your future wife, but it’s the voice
‎[25/01/2021, 22:33:11] Mr G: ‎sticker omitted
[25/01/2021, 22:33:37] Sam: Even at 1.5x, she still sounds like she’s trying to hypnotise me by whispering to me
‎[25/01/2021, 22:34:02] Sam: ‎sticker omitted
[25/01/2021, 22:34:08] Mr G: And she’s clearly not succeeding 😂
[25/01/2021, 22:34:21] Sam: 😂😂
[25/01/2021, 22:35:29] Sam: I’m just loyal to my boi Josè
[25/01/2021, 22:56:06] Mr G: Pfff
[25/01/2021, 23:05:32] Mr G: Would it be ok if still accepted your offer to take the car to Manchester on Friday? I know this is probably asking a bit too much but I’m really trying to avoid the trainline-which-must-not-be-named
[25/01/2021, 23:06:01] Mr G: But it’s probably not even legal due to insurance issues ?
[25/01/2021, 23:07:05] Sam: I could get you insured no problem but I need it for work on Friday as I’m in the office shooting my big movie 😂
[25/01/2021, 23:07:16] Sam: What time would you need it?
[25/01/2021, 23:07:28] Mr G: Oh 😂
[25/01/2021, 23:08:08] Mr G: Well most of the day, I need to be there at 14:30, so I guess leave Newcastle by 11:30?
[25/01/2021, 23:08:17] Mr G: And be back at 18:30
[25/01/2021, 23:08:42] Mr G: It’s a bit of a stretch..
[25/01/2021, 23:11:02] Sam: Oh I don’t finish work till 14:30 ☹️
[25/01/2021, 23:11:33] Mr G: Ok, no worries :)
[25/01/2021, 23:11:42] Mr G: I’ll try Lner !

[25/01/2021, 23:12:02] Mr G: I got my refund and even compensation f😁
[25/01/2021, 23:12:12] Sam: 👏🏼
[25/01/2021, 23:12:14] Mr G: Maybe I can get another compensation lol
[25/01/2021, 23:12:32] Sam: As long as you don’t get booted out of the country 😂
[25/01/2021, 23:13:46] Mr G: Have you heard just eat’s advert with snoop dogg ?
[25/01/2021, 23:14:17] Mr G: It had no right to be that good
[25/01/2021, 23:15:02] Sam: My mum is actually a huge snoop dog fan 😂
[25/01/2021, 23:16:36] Sam: I haven’t heard it
[25/01/2021, 23:17:03] Mr G: It’s an actual song
[25/01/2021, 23:17:10] Mr G: She has good taste then haha

[25/01/2021, 23:30:40] Mr G: I’ve never watched this series but heard it’s very good
[25/01/2021, 23:30:53] Sam: It’s amazing
[25/01/2021, 23:31:03] Sam: One of the best things I’ve ever watched
[25/01/2021, 23:31:21] Sam: You might struggle with the brummy accent
[26/01/2021, 00:05:49] Mr G: I’ve heard that as well
[26/01/2021, 00:05:59] Mr G: Im watching family guy and American dad
[26/01/2021, 00:06:04] Mr G: Haven’t seen them in year
[26/01/2021, 00:06:06] Mr G: Years
[26/01/2021, 00:06:08] Mr G: Hilarious
‎[26/01/2021, 08:38:39] Sam: ‎image omitted
[26/01/2021, 08:39:19] Sam: We’re all getting thermometers at work and have to start taking our temperature before we can come to work
[26/01/2021, 10:40:51] Sam: They’ve just announced they’re starting redundancies at Nissan 😳
‎[26/01/2021, 11:21:14] Sam: ‎image omitted
[26/01/2021, 15:43:34] Mr G: Oh no! Can it affect you?
[26/01/2021, 15:43:48] Mr G: Ahahah
[26/01/2021, 15:43:50] Mr G: Too real
‎[26/01/2021, 15:43:54] Mr G: ‎image omitted
[26/01/2021, 15:46:03] Sam: Do you have a favourite spoon tho? 😂
[26/01/2021, 15:46:43] Sam: Yes, but positively. There are a lot of seniors looking at taking voluntary redundancy because the package is fab, so might be room to move up
[26/01/2021, 17:22:32] Mr G: Not yet. But my dad has always had now that you mention it 😂
[26/01/2021, 17:23:05] Mr G: I’ve told you this but I’m craving for one of those packages 😂
[26/01/2021, 17:23:22] Mr G: Hope that you manage to pull something nice out of it then !
[26/01/2021, 21:43:01] Sam: Aww that’s so canny
[26/01/2021, 21:44:38] Sam: How did your day go? Looks like you had fun 😂
[26/01/2021, 21:48:15] Mr G: Haha mostly boring, but with fun bits
[26/01/2021, 21:48:20] Mr G: I’m exhausted though
[26/01/2021, 21:49:03] Mr G: Yours ?
[26/01/2021, 21:49:32] Mr G: Just ordered Lebanese food on just eat
[26/01/2021, 21:49:46] Mr G: I see Lebanese food, Lebanese food sears me
[26/01/2021, 21:50:02] Mr G: Doesn’t work as great as snoop but the food is deli 😂
[26/01/2021, 22:02:08] Sam: I baked brownies. That was a high point.
[26/01/2021, 22:02:42] Sam: Are you working down there again tomorrow?
[26/01/2021, 22:03:06] Sam: I think brownies might be my forté btw
[26/01/2021, 22:03:59] Sam: How much humus did you order? 🤤
[26/01/2021, 22:05:36] Mr G: No, back home tomorrow
[26/01/2021, 22:05:42] Mr G: 0 lol
[26/01/2021, 22:05:44] Mr G: Just a wrap
[26/01/2021, 22:05:53] Mr G: I think I’m putting on some weight
[26/01/2021, 22:06:19] Sam: No.... humus?? 😢
[26/01/2021, 22:06:24] Sam: I feel bad for you
[26/01/2021, 22:06:30] Sam: Nonsense
[26/01/2021, 22:06:38] Sam: It’s just your winter layer
[26/01/2021, 22:06:53] Sam: Like a seal pup
[26/01/2021, 22:07:07] Mr G: Hehehe

[26/01/2021, 22:07:56] Sam: Oooooooooo what kind?!
[26/01/2021, 22:08:03] Sam: Nerdy ones?
[26/01/2021, 22:08:17] Mr G: Both civil engineering and web developer
[26/01/2021, 22:08:28] Mr G: Actually have a web dev interview on Friday 😬
[26/01/2021, 22:08:35] Sam: 👏🏼👏🏼
[26/01/2021, 22:08:39] Sam: Wahhhhhhhh!!
[26/01/2021, 22:08:49] Sam: I think I’m going to Aberdeen
[26/01/2021, 22:08:54] Mr G: Forever ?
[26/01/2021, 22:09:19] Sam: I was gonna ask if you wanted to come but if you’re gonna be schmoozing employers...
[26/01/2021, 22:09:23] Sam: God no
[26/01/2021, 22:09:26] Sam: Weekend
[26/01/2021, 22:09:47] Sam: I have an electrical fault somewhere that needs investigation
[26/01/2021, 22:09:53] Mr G: Haha yeah
[26/01/2021, 22:10:09] Sam: And some sea air
[26/01/2021, 22:10:10] Mr G: Also this house needs some serious tidying up and cleaning
[26/01/2021, 22:10:12] Mr G: Thanks
[26/01/2021, 22:10:37] Mr G: Can you actually go?
[26/01/2021, 22:10:53] Sam: Yeah, I’m a landlord and I need to do electrical repairs
[26/01/2021, 22:11:10] Sam: It’s allowed 😌
[26/01/2021, 22:11:49] Sam: Plus my friend is getting the results of her biopsy (maybe cancer) so I want to be there
[26/01/2021, 22:12:38] Mr G: Oh ok
[26/01/2021, 22:12:42] Mr G: Yes that makes sense
[26/01/2021, 22:12:50] Sam: Just incase she needs some good snugs
[26/01/2021, 22:12:51] Mr G: When does she get the results ?
[26/01/2021, 22:13:01] Mr G: Take the brownies
[26/01/2021, 22:13:18] Sam: Biopsy is tomorrow and they said a few days
[26/01/2021, 22:13:49] Sam: That’s a good idea. I’ll make her a batch
[26/01/2021, 22:13:57] Mr G: Biopsy always leads me to think they cut open the person alive
[26/01/2021, 22:14:07] Sam: It’s with a needle
[26/01/2021, 22:14:18] Sam: She can’t even have anyone in with her
[26/01/2021, 22:14:31] Sam: She’s Scottish, so she’s tough as f**k, but still
[26/01/2021, 22:14:42] Sam: It’s scary when you’re just a tiny woman
[26/01/2021, 22:17:41] Mr G: I know :(
[26/01/2021, 22:17:46] Mr G: Let’s hope it’s nothing
[26/01/2021, 22:17:57] Mr G: And give her lots of snugs
[26/01/2021, 22:18:00] Mr G: And brownies
[26/01/2021, 22:18:16] Sam: She’s getting all the good snugs
‎[27/01/2021, 11:38:38] Mr G: ‎image omitted
[27/01/2021, 11:38:53] Mr G: Yesterday we had to buy some sealant to fill up a hole we drilled on the bridge
[27/01/2021, 11:39:05] Mr G: The names of the things I have to claim as an expense
[27/01/2021, 11:39:15] Mr G: No nonsense sealant gun. Sticks like shit
[27/01/2021, 11:39:19] Mr G: 😂
[27/01/2021, 11:39:38] Sam: 😂😂😂 first lube, now this
[27/01/2021, 11:39:56] Sam: Your expense department must have a field day 😂😂
[27/01/2021, 11:40:06] Mr G: 😂
[27/01/2021, 11:44:34] Mr G: The guys at screwfix too
[27/01/2021, 14:32:11] Mr G: Feels so scamy seeing festivals promoting themselves on social media for a few months time when they have absolutely no idea if they will be able to pull it off, and most likely it will be impossible
[27/01/2021, 14:32:31] Mr G: They do this with loads of people calling them out for not even having sorted out refunds from last year
[27/01/2021, 14:32:35] Mr G: This should be illegal
[27/01/2021, 14:32:55] Sam: Agreed!
[27/01/2021, 14:33:01] Sam: It probably is 😂
[27/01/2021, 14:33:25] Sam: I’ve just planned my outer Hebrides trip for first week in May 🥰
[27/01/2021, 14:33:42] Sam: Can’t get cancelled if it’s just me and my tent 😊
[27/01/2021, 14:35:06] Mr G: Any word from the snowtrip?
[27/01/2021, 14:36:25] Sam: No but I’m planning to hike the Northumberland coast the same week, so I’ve already mentally prepared myself for cancellation
[27/01/2021, 14:36:47] Mr G: That’s good
[27/01/2021, 14:37:33] Sam: My “drink in every pub I pass” trip
[27/01/2021, 14:37:53] Mr G: BYOB edition
[27/01/2021, 14:37:56] Mr G: 😂
[27/01/2021, 14:38:36] Sam: Do a shot every time you see a castle
[27/01/2021, 15:12:02] Sam: Are you home yet?
[27/01/2021, 15:21:57] Mr G: What do you mean?
[27/01/2021, 15:22:25] Sam: Back in the toon
[27/01/2021, 15:23:04] Mr G: Yeah I arrived yesterday
[27/01/2021, 15:23:19] Sam: Ah okay
[27/01/2021, 15:32:35] Mr G: Ready to claim an extra day on my timesheet tomorrow 🙌
[27/01/2021, 15:45:25] Mr G: I sent a few cvs to Dubai yesterday
‎[27/01/2021, 15:51:10] Mr G: ‎image omitted
[27/01/2021, 15:51:41] Sam: Would you want to work there?
[27/01/2021, 15:51:48] Mr G: Yes!
[27/01/2021, 15:52:12] Mr G: Dubai has the Hong Kong feel to it. You know there was this one time in asia...
[27/01/2021, 15:52:17] Mr G: 😂
[27/01/2021, 15:52:37] Sam: It’s my worst nightmare 😂 I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you though!
[27/01/2021, 15:52:56] Mr G: I would like to try! Despite the bad fame it has a lot to offer. Civil engineering there is insane and it is connected to everywhere in the world !
[27/01/2021, 15:53:13] Mr G: Why? I mean despite the very bad experiences you had there
[27/01/2021, 15:53:18] Sam: Oh yeah, for construction it’s amazing
[27/01/2021, 15:53:37] Sam: Baking hot cities don’t float my boat
[27/01/2021, 15:53:45] Sam: I need water and green
[27/01/2021, 15:54:15] Sam: I went to New York and spent 90% of my time in Central Park 🤷🏼‍♀️
[27/01/2021, 15:54:23] Mr G: If I were reading this sentence before moving to the uk I would have absolutely no idea what you had just said
[27/01/2021, 15:54:30] Sam: Iceland is my dream working destination
[27/01/2021, 15:54:34] Sam: And living destination
[27/01/2021, 15:54:40] Sam: 😂😂
[27/01/2021, 15:54:43] Mr G: Aaah I’m more big city, beach and warmth ! But I do like some green too
[27/01/2021, 15:55:11] Sam: You’re the friend i visit to party on the weekend
[27/01/2021, 15:55:16] Mr G: Ahah
[27/01/2021, 15:55:20] Sam: The go home to my pretty garden 😂
[27/01/2021, 15:55:35] Mr G: But Dubai is too hot. I prefer tropical hot, not baking hot
[27/01/2021, 15:55:50] Mr G: I would give it a try though!
[27/01/2021, 15:56:05] Sam: I also like countries I can go all in with a PDA every now and again without getting arrested
[27/01/2021, 15:57:13] Mr G: Yeah
[27/01/2021, 15:57:26] Mr G: Dubai is not ideal

[27/01/2021, 17:34:47] Mr G: But I need to stop eating shit
[27/01/2021, 21:31:58] Sam: Bridgerton on Netflix 👌🏼
[27/01/2021, 21:32:10] Sam: How did i miss this?! 😍
[28/01/2021, 11:50:49] Mr G: Do you know of any place between Newcastle and Manchester I could stop for a cheap sleep ?
[28/01/2021, 11:55:23] Sam: I’ve never stopped on the way
[28/01/2021, 11:56:27] Sam: Easy hotel in Leeds? The one in Newcastle is lovely and it’s only 22/night

[28/01/2021, 12:01:24] Mr G: Seems like an option
[28/01/2021, 12:01:35] Mr G: The problem is that I need to have an interview
[28/01/2021, 12:01:47] Mr G: So I need good internet and preferably a desk
[28/01/2021, 12:05:01] Sam: Can you not just find a nice hotel and sit in their lobby pretending you’re waiting for someone?
[28/01/2021, 12:05:25] Sam: They usually have free WiFi in reception
[28/01/2021, 12:05:24] Mr G: I also need to sleep
[28/01/2021, 12:05:26] Mr G: 😂
[28/01/2021, 12:05:29] Sam: Ah okay
[28/01/2021, 12:05:36] Sam: Are you going down there late?
[28/01/2021, 12:06:00] Mr G: Don’t know yet
[28/01/2021, 12:06:04] Mr G: I’m figuring my options
[28/01/2021, 12:06:11] Mr G: Trying to avoid taking the train
[28/01/2021, 12:06:44] Sam: Wise move
[28/01/2021, 12:20:05] Mr G: I think I’m going to just go after the interview
[28/01/2021, 12:20:13] Mr G: It’s a 2:30h drive
[28/01/2021, 12:20:18] Mr G: Hassle

[28/01/2021, 12:24:32] Sam: It’s such a shame it’s lockdown or I would have went with you and we could have stayed with some of my uni mates. I love Manchester
[28/01/2021, 12:58:15] Mr G: I know!!
[28/01/2021, 13:05:17] Mr G: How much do you reckon I spend in fuel on a trip there ?
[28/01/2021, 13:05:41] Mr G: I used a calculator online and it estimated 15£ each way. Does it make sense ?
[28/01/2021, 13:18:47] Sam: We do 40p/mile at work I think
[28/01/2021, 13:18:50] Sam: 😂
[28/01/2021, 13:20:17] Mr G: What is that? What you claim back ?
[28/01/2021, 13:20:55] Mr G: That’s way more than 15£ 😂
[28/01/2021, 13:54:25] Sam: Petrol and car depreciation
[28/01/2021, 13:55:04] Mr G: I’m going by car !
[28/01/2021, 13:55:08] Mr G: Decided
[28/01/2021, 13:55:37] Mr G: With the extra money from transpennine compensation 😂
[28/01/2021, 15:12:32] Sam: Have you managed to get a car?
[28/01/2021, 15:25:43] Mr G: Not yet, tomorrow when you give it to me
[28/01/2021, 15:25:47] Mr G: 😆
[28/01/2021, 15:26:10] Sam: Okay, just come up to Aberdeen and collect it 👍🏼
[28/01/2021, 15:26:19] Mr G: Hehe
[28/01/2021, 15:26:24] Mr G: Are you setting off tomorrow ?
[28/01/2021, 15:27:44] Sam: Yeah straight from work
[28/01/2021, 15:27:59] Mr G: Ah alright
[28/01/2021, 15:28:04] Sam: My mum wants to come but I reeeeally just want one whole day to myself
[28/01/2021, 15:28:15] Mr G: I got a Vauxhall cross from enterprise
[28/01/2021, 15:28:40] Mr G: Haha I get you, I’m really feeling the vibe of driving the whole day by myself tomorrow too 😂

[29/01/2021, 10:36:47] Mr G: I just had an interview
[29/01/2021, 10:37:08] Mr G: I think I messed up a bit 😣 when they start asking about my developer experience
[29/01/2021, 10:37:19] Mr G: Have you ever fell in love during an interview ?
[29/01/2021, 10:39:31] Sam: With the job or the interviewer?
[29/01/2021, 10:39:59] Mr G: The interviewer 😂
[29/01/2021, 10:40:05] Mr G: The job was quite good too
[29/01/2021, 10:40:28] Sam: No but I’ve had the guy fall in love with me 😂
[29/01/2021, 10:41:14] Mr G: The interviewer? How did that play out ? Haha
[29/01/2021, 10:41:49] Sam: I got the job then things went downhill fast when he realised the feeling was no reciprocated
[29/01/2021, 10:42:05] Sam: My first boss at Nissan
[29/01/2021, 10:43:00] Mr G: Oof
[29/01/2021, 10:43:14] Mr G: Yeah probably not a good idea
[29/01/2021, 10:43:21] Mr G: But he was ok about it ? Or weird
[29/01/2021, 10:45:37] Sam: It was awful
[29/01/2021, 10:45:53] Sam: He named his baby samantha
[29/01/2021, 10:46:27] Mr G: Ohhh ok he was weird lol
[29/01/2021, 10:46:57] Mr G: Well I did a bit of stalking. The healthy one, found her on Facebook and she has Carla as a friend in common
[29/01/2021, 10:47:27] Mr G: Anyway you need to keep it professional, but I was struggling to concentrate during the interview 😅
[29/01/2021, 10:48:46] Sam: 😂
[29/01/2021, 20:49:09] Mr G: I’m in coxhoe

[29/01/2021, 21:57:56] Sam: The innuendo just keeps on giving today 😍
[29/01/2021, 21:57:57] Mr G: She wakes up by the end of the video
[29/01/2021, 21:58:09] Mr G: This man is dead already
[29/01/2021, 21:58:12] Sam: 😂😂
[29/01/2021, 21:58:42] Sam: I bet that was the most action he got in the bedroom for a solid month after that 😂
[29/01/2021, 21:59:26] Sam: Did you get your visa sorted?
[29/01/2021, 21:59:33] Mr G: Passport

[29/01/2021, 21:59:51] Sam: Sweet 👌🏼
[29/01/2021, 22:00:05] Mr G: I cut myself while shaving today
[29/01/2021, 22:00:17] Sam: No, I’m still in Newcastle. My neighbour just got home from working up there and said the roads were horrific
[29/01/2021, 22:00:17] Mr G: That will be on my passport photo for 5 years now 😂
[29/01/2021, 22:00:29] Mr G: ID card as well
[29/01/2021, 22:00:47] Sam: Badly?? 😧
[29/01/2021, 22:00:53] Mr G: No
[29/01/2021, 22:01:06] Mr G: Just a tiny cut
[29/01/2021, 22:01:11] Mr G: But you can see on the picture
[29/01/2021, 22:01:17] Sam: I just re-pierced my own ear
[29/01/2021, 22:01:32] Mr G: Wild!
[29/01/2021, 22:01:39] Mr G: Did it hurt ?
[29/01/2021, 22:01:49] Sam: Yes. A lot 😂
[29/01/2021, 22:02:54] Sam: I think I’m going to book in for a few more piercings when lockdown ends. Want to come and get something pierced with me??
[29/01/2021, 22:03:13] Mr G: 1. Why?
[29/01/2021, 22:03:18] Mr G: 2. 😏
[29/01/2021, 22:03:30] Mr G: Something?!
[29/01/2021, 22:03:42] Sam: 😂😂
[29/01/2021, 22:04:00] Sam: I’m not gonna tell you what to pierce man, that’s on you
[29/01/2021, 22:04:05] Sam: Less commitment than a tattoo
[29/01/2021, 22:04:05] Mr G: Haha
[29/01/2021, 22:04:17] Mr G: I’m already all pierced
[29/01/2021, 22:04:25] Mr G: But only one is open
[29/01/2021, 22:04:33] Mr G: Surprisingly actually
[29/01/2021, 22:04:38] Mr G: I found out the other day
[29/01/2021, 22:04:57] Mr G: But no, I need to heal this body, it’s falling into pieces
[29/01/2021, 22:05:00] Mr G: 😂
[29/01/2021, 22:05:26] Mr G: I might dye my hair blond. That will be my lockdown meltdown
[29/01/2021, 22:05:47] Sam: I was thinking pink ombré
[29/01/2021, 22:06:00] Sam: But I’ve never dyed my hair
[29/01/2021, 22:06:04] Mr G: I’m not that crazy yet
[29/01/2021, 22:06:08] Mr G: 😂
[29/01/2021, 22:06:34] Sam: Well will you come and hold me hand? Last time I got pierced I fainted 😂
[29/01/2021, 22:06:42] Sam: *my
[29/01/2021, 22:07:09] Sam: Also... I’m gonna need more details on this

[29/01/2021, 22:12:16] Sam: I have 6. I think I want another 3 in my ears
[29/01/2021, 22:12:25] Sam: The Filipino guys used to to some freaky piercing stuff offshore and let me watch
[29/01/2021, 22:12:40] Sam: Implants...
[29/01/2021, 22:15:14] Sam: I like this look on you
[29/01/2021, 22:16:14] Sam: It’s very Slash
[29/01/2021, 22:16:31] Sam: From back in the day

[30/01/2021, 10:30:34] Sam: I used to HATE walking up that street
[30/01/2021, 11:58:06] Mr G: I think so
[30/01/2021, 23:08:44] Sam: Mr Robot on Amazon Prime 💯
[01/02/2021, 13:51:57] Sam: I’m uploading all the clips off my phone for the team video and half my camera roll is photos of teenage you 😂
[01/02/2021, 14:02:46] Mr G: That is not creepy 😂
[01/02/2021, 14:02:58] Mr G: I need to clear my phone too
[01/02/2021, 14:03:11] Mr G: There’s a lot of memes, crap and maybe some porn too
[01/02/2021, 14:03:45] Sam: I’m clearing mine now, between the underage photos and NSFW memes, I feel like an utter creep 😂😏
[01/02/2021, 14:04:02] Mr G: Hehe
[01/02/2021, 14:04:16] Mr G: How did the shooting go ?
[01/02/2021, 14:04:29] Sam: Fine, the guys were so nervous 😂
[01/02/2021, 14:04:35] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 14:04:41] Mr G: Will I ever see the result ?
[01/02/2021, 14:05:07] Sam: Absolutely not 😂

[01/02/2021, 14:11:36] Sam: I think that’s why it felt so real 😂 it’s a probable outcome 😂
[01/02/2021, 14:12:21] Sam: It was handmaids tale, Mr Robot and Bridgerton all rolled into one 🙈 I need to stop watching so much Netflix 😂
[01/02/2021, 16:14:36] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:02:53] Sam: Did you hear back about the job?
[01/02/2021, 19:11:26] Mr G: Not yet
[01/02/2021, 19:11:36] Mr G: I get a call every now and then for others
[01/02/2021, 19:12:10] Mr G: But leading to nowhere
[01/02/2021, 19:12:15] Mr G: It’s good to feel groomed
[01/02/2021, 19:12:19] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:12:35] Sam: I wish someone would groom me 😒
[01/02/2021, 19:12:42] Sam: 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:13:20] Sam: At least if they don’t call you can schweff the interviewer 👌🏼
[01/02/2021, 19:13:32] Mr G: Ahahaaaaaaaa
[01/02/2021, 19:13:36] Mr G: You remember
[01/02/2021, 19:13:43] Mr G: That was my first thought yesterday
[01/02/2021, 19:14:02] Mr G: Really I felt so stupid. I spent the day driving to Manchester kind of thinking about her
[01/02/2021, 19:14:16] Mr G: I need to go out a bit more 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:15:31] Sam: Be careful, it might be like when you haven’t eaten for ages and suddenly a kebab looks yummy
[01/02/2021, 19:15:42] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:15:44] Sam: Lockdown is gonna have people making all sorts of bad choices 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:15:58] Mr G: True 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:16:02] Mr G: She was stunning though
[01/02/2021, 19:16:15] Mr G: Or maybe not who knows 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:16:22] Sam: If you don’t hear back then go for it
[01/02/2021, 19:16:43] Mr G: Lol I was very professional though
[01/02/2021, 19:17:04] Mr G: Aside from the fact that I may have found her on Facebook
[01/02/2021, 19:17:16] Mr G: But that’s because her LinkedIn was available
[01/02/2021, 19:17:18] Sam: A guy stalked me from the keilder observatory by finding out my details from the booking system when I visited
[01/02/2021, 19:17:19] Mr G: LinkedIn is safe
[01/02/2021, 19:17:36] Sam: He admitted it was wholly unprofessional but I was kinda impressed by his balls
[01/02/2021, 19:17:47] Sam: Metaphorically speaking
[01/02/2021, 19:22:44] Mr G: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[01/02/2021, 19:22:59] Mr G: I was wondering if he got that far with that message
[01/02/2021, 19:24:06] Sam: Haha not a chance but we’re still friends
[01/02/2021, 19:24:56] Sam: That was who I was texting about the planets when we had burgers at the beach
[01/02/2021, 19:25:17] Mr G: Ah ok
[01/02/2021, 19:26:04] Sam: He asked me out again a few weeks ago but I think I’ve got the fear now
[01/02/2021, 19:26:18] Sam: I’ve adjusted to being a recluse
[01/02/2021, 19:26:23] Sam: 👵🏼
[01/02/2021, 19:26:31] Mr G: Maybe he’s balls are not that good
[01/02/2021, 19:26:35] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:26:42] Mr G: I know the feeling
[01/02/2021, 19:27:13] Sam: He owns a sous vide. That’s a level of prestigious I’m not ready for
[01/02/2021, 19:27:22] Sam: *pretentious
[01/02/2021, 19:27:28] Mr G: What is that ?
[01/02/2021, 19:27:32] Sam: Exactly.
[01/02/2021, 19:27:51] Sam: You’re a man in your 30s. You’re not supposed to know!
[01/02/2021, 19:30:15] Sam: Literally, dating has just become texting each other once a day the exact same line:
“how’s your day been?” “Yeah fine, you?” “Yeah fine. Up to much tonight?” “Nah, Netflix. You?” “Same”
[01/02/2021, 19:30:52] Sam: Repeat for several months or until one of us dies 😩
[01/02/2021, 19:30:51] Mr G: Omg hot
[01/02/2021, 19:30:52] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:30:56] Mr G: I know...
[01/02/2021, 19:31:22] Mr G: I actually had an actual date yesterday. Actually
[01/02/2021, 19:31:36] Sam: Oh nice!
[01/02/2021, 19:31:55] Sam: How’d it go?
[01/02/2021, 19:32:02] Mr G: But after endless of these lol
[01/02/2021, 19:32:40] Mr G: I’m so tired of explaining the same things over again. Might put my new python skills into practice and code a script for that first convo 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:32:49] Mr G: Went very nice actually
[01/02/2021, 19:33:13] Sam: 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
[01/02/2021, 19:33:23] Mr G: But I deffo need more people skills
[01/02/2021, 19:33:34] Sam: Why?
[01/02/2021, 19:34:23] Mr G: Ok I need to ask you something
[01/02/2021, 19:34:25] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:34:31] Mr G: I hope is not weird
[01/02/2021, 19:34:41] Sam: Hit me
[01/02/2021, 19:34:53] Mr G: I agree that bumble is crap
[01/02/2021, 19:35:00] Sam: Also agree
[01/02/2021, 19:35:04] Mr G: I don’t mind texting first
[01/02/2021, 19:35:19] Mr G: I also think that it’s ok for the other side to ask first. You know just be natural
[01/02/2021, 19:35:30] Mr G: Anyway, why does the guy have to make the move 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:35:34] Sam: Disagree
[01/02/2021, 19:36:40] Sam: Okay, let me word this right
[01/02/2021, 19:36:50] Sam: Although we’ve definitely had this conversation
[01/02/2021, 19:38:02] Mr G: It’s just that logic only leaves room on this side for us to be either successful or creeps
[01/02/2021, 19:38:22] Mr G: There’s no in between. It’s too much pressure and gets awkward
[01/02/2021, 19:38:44] Mr G: I guess I’m not much into this dating thing. I like more fluidity.
[01/02/2021, 19:38:53] Sam: Wrong, you have the fuckboy zone
[01/02/2021, 19:42:17] Mr G: Oh that’s reassuring
[01/02/2021, 19:42:19] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:42:33] Sam: I just feel, that as a feminine woman, that if the man doesn’t have the balls to make the first move when I’ve made it obvious I like him, then he’s probably going to dither about other difficult situations. Which forces the woman to step into the manly role
[01/02/2021, 19:42:50] Sam: No woman wants to wear the pants
[01/02/2021, 19:43:09] Mr G: It’s not wearing the pants in my opinion
[01/02/2021, 19:43:30] Mr G: But if a guy makes the move and it’s rejected he’s  a creep
[01/02/2021, 19:44:05] Mr G: Anyway making the first move is so awkward. It’s so cliche 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:44:09] Mr G: On a normal date
[01/02/2021, 19:44:30] Sam: If I’m alone with a guy and have been alone with him several times and enjoyed his company (probably a bit of flirting in between) then I would not think he was a creep if he made the first move
[01/02/2021, 19:44:58] Mr G: But it’s always going to be awkward. There will always be 2 seconds of an awkward stare
[01/02/2021, 19:45:03] Sam: Anything after a second date you pretty much have a green light
[01/02/2021, 19:45:11] Mr G: 2 umbearable seconds 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:45:13] Sam: Yeah... that’s the good bit
[01/02/2021, 19:45:46] Sam: Unless he follows it up with a hug or a handshake 🙄
[01/02/2021, 19:46:07] Sam: You do you. I just know I’d rather wait a million years before making the first move
[01/02/2021, 19:46:59] Mr G: Fair
[01/02/2021, 19:48:20] Mr G: I think that if you really really like italian food and you only go to Italian restaurants you’re going to miss out sushi
[01/02/2021, 19:48:41] Mr G: That you might not enjoy even!
[01/02/2021, 19:54:29] Sam: Don’t worry about it, I think there will always be women who are happy to make the first move on you
[01/02/2021, 19:55:22] Sam: I think maybe we both just have a little rejection anxiety 😅
[01/02/2021, 19:55:39] Mr G: Yes 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:55:41] Mr G: It’s that
[01/02/2021, 19:56:10] Mr G: The outcome of me being very careful is a lot of lost opportunities and no rejections, not sure how to handle one
[01/02/2021, 19:56:13] Mr G: But anyway
[01/02/2021, 19:56:24] Mr G: I think it’s ok guys doing th first move
[01/02/2021, 19:56:33] Mr G: That’s fine I accept that it’s how it is
[01/02/2021, 19:56:44] Mr G: It’s just these barriers stand in the way of nice things 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:56:46] Sam: Then what makes you think you’d be rejected?
[01/02/2021, 19:56:49] Mr G: Formalities
[01/02/2021, 19:56:56] Sam: I can’t imagine a woman rejecting you
[01/02/2021, 19:57:11] Sam: Get drunk 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:57:12] Mr G: Omg!

[01/02/2021, 19:58:02] Mr G: Sorry
[01/02/2021, 19:58:07] Mr G: Give me mins
[01/02/2021, 19:59:08] Mr G: I was very positive that it wasn’t a rejection
[01/02/2021, 19:59:18] Mr G: It’s just I can’t pass that awkward phase 😂
[01/02/2021, 19:59:32] Mr G: It was a first date anyway
[01/02/2021, 20:00:12] Sam: Did she react positively after the date and wants to see you again?
[01/02/2021, 20:02:19] Mr G: Yes
[01/02/2021, 20:02:40] Mr G: She talked about this “restraining order” I guess it’s a document regarding covid or something
[01/02/2021, 20:02:52] Sam: 😂😂

[01/02/2021, 20:15:44] Mr G: Girlfriend so too strong of a word
[01/02/2021, 20:15:55] Mr G: Not aiming for that 😅
[01/02/2021, 20:45:11] Sam: I don’t know why you’re so scared of the G word 😂

[01/02/2021, 21:29:15] Mr G: G word 😅
[01/02/2021, 21:30:10] Mr G: It’s just that I end up usually thinking after “I probably shouldn’t have gotten into this “ 😂
[01/02/2021, 21:31:57] Sam: Because you date bossy ladies who make the first move 😂
[01/02/2021, 21:32:03] Sam: Just kidding 😂
[01/02/2021, 21:32:17] Sam: You just haven’t found the right one yet 😌
[01/02/2021, 21:32:53] Mr G: Oof
[01/02/2021, 21:33:25] Mr G: I want to be offended but that is literally what happened with my last relationship
[01/02/2021, 21:33:51] Mr G: She pulled me out of the club, pushed me to the wall, and got it over with 😂
[01/02/2021, 21:34:03] Mr G: But tbf, she had a boyfriend when we met
[01/02/2021, 21:34:12] Mr G: So confusing signs
[01/02/2021, 21:34:17] Mr G: Can’t compute
[01/02/2021, 21:34:50] Mr G: Anyway, I always find out that I’m fine by my own
[01/02/2021, 21:39:37] Sam: You make it sound so romantic ❤️😂
[01/02/2021, 21:40:00] Mr G: It was actually
[01/02/2021, 21:40:08] Mr G: It was cute all things considered
[01/02/2021, 21:40:12] Mr G: There was more into it
[01/02/2021, 21:40:56] Sam: To be fair, it’s pretty much how all my best relationships started 🤔
[01/02/2021, 21:42:55] Mr G: You have to admit it’s original at least 😂
[01/02/2021, 21:47:54] Sam: Ah nightclubs... those were the days 😭
[01/02/2021, 21:52:47] Sam: I can imagine you making the first move in a nightclub situation. Maybe you just need a stiff drink
[01/02/2021, 21:52:55] Sam: Or loud music 😂
[01/02/2021, 21:53:15] Mr G: Yes... I need environment, I need vibe and engagement
[01/02/2021, 21:53:25] Mr G: 😅
[01/02/2021, 21:53:34] Mr G: I haven’t done this in years though
[01/02/2021, 21:53:51] Mr G: Drinks help yes
[01/02/2021, 21:54:03] Mr G: But you understand that it’s just a problem of burocracy ?😂
[01/02/2021, 21:54:36] Sam: You’re just stubborn 😂
[01/02/2021, 22:04:30] Mr G: 😂
[01/02/2021, 22:30:12] Sam: It’s better to get shot down at the start anyway before you catch some feels, believe me 😅 Get that second date booked in and go for it 💋💪🏼
[02/02/2021, 01:14:04] Mr G: It’s already booked
[02/02/2021, 01:14:13] Mr G: But I’m never sure you know lool

[02/02/2021, 14:53:50] Sam: 😂
[02/02/2021, 14:54:38] Mr G: I’ve done nothing 😂 i have the inverse feeling
[02/02/2021, 14:55:09] Mr G: Do you have an Alexa ?
[02/02/2021, 14:55:18] Sam: Several
[02/02/2021, 14:55:26] Mr G: Tell all of them to fart
[02/02/2021, 14:55:28] Mr G: 🤣

[02/02/2021, 14:55:36] Sam: What?!!
[02/02/2021, 14:55:57] Sam: Is that seriously what you’ve been doing all day? 😐

[02/02/2021, 17:05:46] Sam: Wow! It pays to have a woman on the inside 😉
[02/02/2021, 17:07:16] Mr G: I don’t know why but our conversations always result in innuendo
[02/02/2021, 17:07:49] Sam: What can I say, it’s been a long lockdown 😅😂
[02/02/2021, 17:38:19] Mr G: https://www.facebook.com/199098633470668/posts/8644755665571547/?vh=e&d=n
[02/02/2021, 17:41:50] Sam: Omg that’s shameful!!
[02/02/2021, 17:43:52] Sam: And kids today are missing a year of school
[02/02/2021, 17:44:02] Sam: They don’t stand a chance
[02/02/2021, 17:45:13] Mr G: I can accept if you don’t recognise Anne frank and even Churchill or Lincoln. But not knowing what’s a continent ??
[02/02/2021, 17:45:38] Sam: And basic maths
[02/02/2021, 18:07:25] Mr G: What did Lauren do ?
[02/02/2021, 18:08:17] Sam: Rezi’s Lauren?
[02/02/2021, 18:08:24] Mr G: Yes
[02/02/2021, 18:08:35] Sam: She was a dancer
[02/02/2021, 18:09:13] Mr G: I know. And I understood that and didn’t want to elaborate at the time. But can you please elaborate? 😅
[02/02/2021, 18:09:31] Sam: An exotic dancer
[02/02/2021, 18:09:35] Mr G: No judging
[02/02/2021, 18:09:58] Sam: I’d never judge anyone but the men who actually hand over money for this
[02/02/2021, 18:09:59] Mr G: But anything out of the ordinary or something like what you’d see on revolution de Cuba? Those dancers going around
[02/02/2021, 18:10:06] Sam: Power to her 😂
[02/02/2021, 18:10:10] Sam: Lap dancing
[02/02/2021, 18:10:48] Mr G: Ok. But (I’m sorry for this question, I really like her I never judged her) was it ever close to prostitution?
[02/02/2021, 18:11:25] Sam: She didn’t have sex, so no. Clubs in Newcastle have a no-touching policy
[02/02/2021, 18:11:41] Mr G: Ok
[02/02/2021, 18:11:42] Sam: The dancers can touch you but you can’t touch them
[02/02/2021, 18:12:08] Sam: Sometimes it happens in the back room for extra, but you lose your job if you get caught
[02/02/2021, 18:12:17] Mr G: Ok
[02/02/2021, 18:12:21] Mr G: Thanks
[02/02/2021, 18:12:24] Sam: Why?
[02/02/2021, 18:13:29] Mr G: Because I matched this girl and we talked about meeting. Since the weather is crap she suggested something indoors, which I’m fine.
She told me she was a dancer before covid but didn’t elaborate. So I did my stalking, found her on Facebook, and she’s friends with Lauren. I figure she did the same
[02/02/2021, 18:13:38] Mr G: And now I’m wondering if somethings fishy about this
[02/02/2021, 18:13:50] Mr G: No judging. But not into that too lol
[02/02/2021, 18:14:10] Sam: I can’t imagine you dating a stripper 😂
[02/02/2021, 18:15:24] Sam: Although this doesn’t sound like much of a date 😉
[02/02/2021, 18:15:23] Mr G: Me neither 😂 but I don’t mind she being a stripper. Lauren seemed like a sound person to me at least. I’m just afraid of like
[02/02/2021, 18:15:34] Mr G: Yeah...I’m afraid of that lol
[02/02/2021, 18:15:36] Sam: Lauren was lovely
[02/02/2021, 18:16:48] Mr G: I’m getting the feeling I should probably back out
[02/02/2021, 18:17:49] Sam: It’s just a job at the end of the day. But you need to be very confident and able speak in such a way to convince men to allow you to grind on their... erm... for money 🤷🏼‍♀️
[02/02/2021, 18:18:33] Mr G: I know. But she’s also allowed to meet people for normal dating
[02/02/2021, 18:18:36] Sam: 99.9% chance you won’t need to make the first move though 😂
[02/02/2021, 18:18:41] Mr G: LOL
[02/02/2021, 18:18:55] Mr G: Yeah but at what cost ?
[02/02/2021, 18:18:57] Mr G: 😂
[02/02/2021, 18:19:13] Sam: It’s up to you. If it doesn’t bother you, go for it
[02/02/2021, 18:19:32] Sam: Some people can separate the two things
[02/02/2021, 18:19:53] Mr G: The only thing that’s bothering me is if she’s looking for something else and isn’t being honest with me
[02/02/2021, 18:20:00] Mr G: You feel me? 😂
[02/02/2021, 18:20:03] Mr G: I’m not looking for that
[02/02/2021, 18:20:07] Sam: Looking for what?
[02/02/2021, 18:20:33] Mr G: Paid sex
[02/02/2021, 18:20:43] Mr G: I’m maybe paranoid
[02/02/2021, 18:20:46] Sam: Doubtful
[02/02/2021, 18:21:01] Sam: She’d more likely be upfront about that
[02/02/2021, 18:21:20] Sam: Maybe she was just a normal dancer though 🤷🏼‍♀️
[02/02/2021, 18:21:30] Sam: We’re making a lot of assumptions here
[02/02/2021, 18:21:40] Mr G: I’m pretty sure she did what Lauren did
[02/02/2021, 18:21:47] Sam: I’m making jambalaya 😊 man this smells good
[02/02/2021, 18:21:48] Mr G: Whatever it is
[02/02/2021, 18:21:56] Sam: I wish WhatsApp has smellavision
[02/02/2021, 18:21:56] Mr G: What is that ?
[02/02/2021, 18:22:12] Mr G: That would quickly backfire 😂😂
[02/02/2021, 18:22:25] Sam: Like more spicy paella
[02/02/2021, 18:22:32] Sam: 😂
[02/02/2021, 18:22:51] Mr G: 🤤
[02/02/2021, 18:22:58] Mr G: Want
[02/02/2021, 18:24:11] Sam: It’s my mums fave. She’s a bit down
[02/02/2021, 18:24:18] Sam: This isolation is getting tough
[02/02/2021, 18:24:32] Sam: She’s sad about sir Tom ☹️
[02/02/2021, 18:24:33] Mr G: Nooo why is mama Julie down? :(
[02/02/2021, 18:24:40] Mr G: Send her kudos from me!
[02/02/2021, 18:24:49] Sam: I will ☺️
[02/02/2021, 18:25:05] Mr G: Oh ☹️
[02/02/2021, 18:25:30] Mr G: I only learned about him when he was diagnosed with covid. Was he an important figure ? I read a bit about him
[02/02/2021, 18:25:47] Sam: Yeah, he raised so much money for the NHS
[02/02/2021, 18:26:00] Sam: He was a hero to my mum
[02/02/2021, 18:26:34] Mr G: 99 years is a life well lived, at least you can find some comfort in that !
[02/02/2021, 18:26:42] Mr G: Sorry 101years
[02/02/2021, 18:26:49] Mr G: Meth
[02/02/2021, 18:30:21] Sam: Did you hear back about your MRI?
[02/02/2021, 18:30:32] Mr G: Yes
[02/02/2021, 18:30:56] Mr G: Doctor basically says everything is fairly fine, no damage to the ligaments or tendons
[02/02/2021, 18:31:05] Mr G: There appears to be some inflammation and other stuff
[02/02/2021, 18:31:12] Mr G: And to show this at physio
[02/02/2021, 18:31:18] Mr G: But he doesn’t recommend surgery
[02/02/2021, 18:31:31] Sam: Oh that’s good!

[05/02/2021, 19:54:06] Sam: Errrrr... so I just asked my friend if she made the first move on her boyfriend because he’s super shy
[05/02/2021, 19:55:07] Sam: She didn’t, but she decided to show me what she would do if she had

[05/02/2021, 21:04:22] Mr G: Well
[05/02/2021, 21:04:25] Mr G: That’s good
[05/02/2021, 21:04:45] Mr G: But wedding seems a bit of a push after a kiss 😅
[05/02/2021, 21:04:57] Mr G: If it wasn’t weird and you enjoyed it why not b
[05/02/2021, 21:08:52] Sam: Erm... her boyfriend?! 🤦🏼‍♀️

[05/02/2021, 23:35:51] Sam: That’s my out of heaven dance costume my mum is wearing 🤣
[05/02/2021, 23:36:24] Mr G: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[05/02/2021, 23:36:35] Mr G: That was amazing 😂

[05/02/2021, 23:37:02] Sam: She falls into the bush at one point 😂
[05/02/2021, 23:37:11] Mr G: 😂

[05/02/2021, 23:37:57] Mr G: Is Shaun still alive?
[05/02/2021, 23:38:01] Mr G: Time flies
[05/02/2021, 23:38:16] Mr G: I haven’t been speaking with many people outside of my bubble lately
[05/02/2021, 23:39:00] Sam: He text me a week ago so I think so, but he’s very quiet
[05/02/2021, 23:39:12] Sam: Maz is looking out for him though
[05/02/2021, 23:39:38] Mr G: Good
[05/02/2021, 23:39:42] Mr G: The same goes for rezi
[05/02/2021, 23:39:49] Mr G: Haven’t heard anything about him either
[05/02/2021, 23:40:07] Mr G: Wonder if they talked
[05/02/2021, 23:40:19] Sam: I never hear from him anyway, so that’s not really unusual. I hope they made up though
[06/02/2021, 15:25:59] Sam: Just had an Invisalign consultation... the tool they use to scan your teeth is soooo cool! 🤩 also the receptionist was my best friend from when I was about 6... small world! 😂
[06/02/2021, 16:00:55] Mr G: Ahah like 3D scan?
[06/02/2021, 16:01:04] Mr G: Is that that for braces or anything ?
[06/02/2021, 16:01:13] Mr G: Also, are you still not socialising btw ?
[06/02/2021, 16:03:15] Sam: Yeah for clear braces. I’ve been thinking about it for ages but might as well do it now when nobody can see my mouth anyway 👍🏼
[06/02/2021, 16:03:52] Sam: Not really, I just meet Jayne for coffee now and again because she’s already had covid so there’s no danger of her having it again
[06/02/2021, 16:07:41] Mr G: Haha Ive had it when I was young. A friend of mine just put some and she says the same. I genuinely don’t think they look bad in general
[06/02/2021, 16:08:55] Mr G: Oh ok. Me and Beatriz are cooking a Portuguese dinner for the few of us tonight! Not sure if it’s too many for you but join if you want!
[06/02/2021, 16:11:18] Sam: Ahh that’s so sweet! I’ll pass, but thanks for the invite 😊
[06/02/2021, 18:46:31] Mr G: Ok :)
[07/02/2021, 15:23:40] Sam: How’s it go last night? Did you cook up a storm?
[07/02/2021, 16:01:09] Mr G: Was quite nice
[07/02/2021, 16:01:21] Mr G: Beatriz did most of the cooking though. It was very good
[10/02/2021, 08:21:35] Sam: Want to come snowboarding this weekend? 😬
[10/02/2021, 09:54:57] Mr G: I can’t! Now in addition to my knees my back is also fucked
[10/02/2021, 09:54:59] Mr G: But thanks !
[10/02/2021, 09:56:18] Sam: Nooo! What did you do?! 🤦🏼‍♀️ is this from your gym injury?
[10/02/2021, 09:57:21] Sam: Gary is coming with me 👍🏼🏂 I’m not sure who else can snowboard or ski? 🤔
[10/02/2021, 10:13:30] Mr G: Yes, from December. It’s getting better I guess but it’s still here
[10/02/2021, 10:13:34] Mr G: And it sucks
[10/02/2021, 10:14:29] Mr G: Dobrina and Millie snowboard
[10/02/2021, 10:18:05] Sam: Are they back from Bulgaria?
[10/02/2021, 10:18:24] Mr G: I think so !
[10/02/2021, 10:18:43] Mr G: Where do you snowboard ?
[10/02/2021, 10:19:41] Sam: If it’s just me and Gary we’ll probably drive out to Cumbria and find a hill or a Munro
[10/02/2021, 10:19:49] Sam: Hike up, board down 👌🏼
[10/02/2021, 10:21:56] Mr G: 👌
[10/02/2021, 11:13:21] Mr G: Do you have a snowboard for me ?
[10/02/2021, 11:14:41] Sam: I have spare snowboards and bindings but boots are the problem
[10/02/2021, 11:15:00] Mr G: I can’t do a proper snowboard session
[10/02/2021, 11:15:08] Sam: Mine are a size 4 so you’re obviously not going to fit in those 😂
[10/02/2021, 11:15:10] Mr G: But would love to go down a slope just To say I did
[10/02/2021, 11:15:19] Sam: You could come and sledge? 😂
[10/02/2021, 11:15:44] Sam: Do you have safety boots for work?
[10/02/2021, 11:15:52] Mr G: I do
[10/02/2021, 11:15:58] Sam: 🤔
[10/02/2021, 11:16:26] Mr G: My spider sense is telling me this is a bad idea
[10/02/2021, 11:16:33] Mr G: Better not get excited
[10/02/2021, 11:16:37] Sam: 😂
[10/02/2021, 11:16:41] Mr G: I rather make sure I’m healthy enough
[10/02/2021, 11:16:59] Sam: Just come for the hike
[10/02/2021, 11:17:01] Mr G: I’m doing some very good progression on my knees atm don’t want to ruin that
[10/02/2021, 11:17:13] Mr G: When are you going exactly?
[10/02/2021, 11:17:59] Sam: Probably Saturday when there’s hopefully still snow
[10/02/2021, 15:50:52] Mr G: Read this and reminded me of you

[10/02/2021, 15:58:29] Sam: I would LOVE to see your Reddit search history 😂
[10/02/2021, 15:59:12] Mr G: I don’t use Reddit search function, it’s the biggest crap of the modern age
[10/02/2021, 15:59:41] Mr G: I mostly roam around the front page, videos and some others
[10/02/2021, 16:06:49] Sam: The comments are so funny. I dated an identical twin that came from Alabama... I can relate to so much of this thread 😂
[10/02/2021, 17:06:52] Mr G: Well
[10/02/2021, 17:07:19] Mr G: I think it’s starting to look like I will in fact spend 3 weeks of my AL locked at home

[11/02/2021, 12:57:34] Sam: SURELY by October....?
[11/02/2021, 12:57:55] Mr G: you're going to have your heart broken honey

[11/02/2021, 12:58:32] Sam: Well I’ve bought new sandals now. I’m committed
[11/02/2021, 12:58:33] Mr G: we will have this crap at least until christmas
[11/02/2021, 12:59:27] Sam: When did you reach this level of acceptance?
[11/02/2021, 12:59:33] Sam: I’m still in the denial phase
[11/02/2021, 13:00:04] Mr G: yes. I think Im reaching some sort of nirvana past the acceptance phase
[11/02/2021, 13:00:12] Mr G: im coining it the delusional phase
[11/02/2021, 13:00:19] Mr G: where I book holidays in my dreams
[11/02/2021, 13:00:24] Mr G: 😂
[11/02/2021, 13:01:35] Mr G: Im still considering Dominican Republic but I will only book with max 2 weeks in advance
[11/02/2021, 13:01:48] Mr G: and I will break some rules if it goes forward
[11/02/2021, 13:02:05] Sam: I’m still up for Dominican Republic! I want to spend this voucher!
[11/02/2021, 13:03:16] Mr G: will they let you spend your voucher if the holidays are illegal?
[11/02/2021, 13:03:29] Mr G: honest question
[11/02/2021, 13:03:36] Sam: I have no idea 🤷🏼‍♀️
[11/02/2021, 13:05:13] Mr G: there are 3 issues with this: what sort of border control (im guessing close to none with regards to checking if you go on holidays or essential travel); you need to get tested 3 TIMES; there are no direct flights
[11/02/2021, 13:34:44] Sam: Let’s just keep our fingers crossed for Boris relaxing things in his next major briefing
[11/02/2021, 14:10:17] Mr G: 🤞

[11/02/2021, 14:32:44] Sam: Only thing that’s missing is your donkey 😂
[11/02/2021, 14:33:49] Mr G: Yes
[11/02/2021, 14:33:54] Mr G: I was very feral 😂
[11/02/2021, 15:05:52] Mr G: Why are the Americans allowed to gather at 25k people for the super bowl and have an actual concert but I’m only allowed to socialise with my plants? 😂
[11/02/2021, 16:01:02] Sam: Because the NHS don’t have to look after those idiots when they catch covid
[11/02/2021, 16:01:10] Sam: In the USA, they just let you die
[11/02/2021, 16:03:35] Mr G: 😅
[11/02/2021, 16:03:50] Mr G: I WANT MY LIFE BACK
[11/02/2021, 16:47:08] Sam: You’re dating strippers! You’re living THE life! 😂
[11/02/2021, 19:46:33] Mr G: That’s one for never have I ever
[11/02/2021, 19:46:35] Mr G: 😂
[11/02/2021, 20:31:55] Sam: I think I’d be scared to play that game with you now 😂
[11/02/2021, 20:32:43] Sam: Just been to the beach with Jayne, it was about 20 degrees colder than when we were last there 🥶 I feel like an icepop
[11/02/2021, 23:29:12] Mr G: Oof I imagine
[11/02/2021, 23:29:16] Mr G: Who is Jayne ?
[11/02/2021, 23:38:48] Sam: One of oldest friends, I don’t think you’ve met her yet 😊 we had fish and chips in the car, it was so good ☺️ and i had McDonald’s for lunch so now I feel like a whale 😂
[11/02/2021, 23:40:10] Sam: One of the guys at work ordered me a neon pink hi-viz because I’m always stealing his and he got me it in a MEDIUM. I was mortified 😂 the lockdown chub is real!
[12/02/2021, 14:17:07] Mr G: 😂
[12/02/2021, 14:17:20] Mr G: Medium is not that bad come on!
[12/02/2021, 14:20:32] Sam: The chub is reeeeeeeal!!
[12/02/2021, 15:54:05] Sam: https://www.dancewithrasa.com/holiday/
[12/02/2021, 15:57:21] Sam: I think I might do this. The trip is almost certainly going to get postponed, but it’ll take all the guesswork out of which bars and clubs to go to
[12/02/2021, 15:58:08] Mr G: Honey
[12/02/2021, 15:58:15] Mr G: Do you like to hurt yourself? 😂
[12/02/2021, 15:58:21] Sam: Okay honey is my thing
[12/02/2021, 15:58:30] Mr G: Haha
[12/02/2021, 15:58:36] Mr G: Can I borrow it just for these occasions ?
[12/02/2021, 15:58:47] Sam: It has to happen EVENTUALLY
[12/02/2021, 15:58:54] Sam: I feel like you’ve just given up!
[12/02/2021, 15:58:56] Mr G: Samantha
[12/02/2021, 15:59:17] Mr G: It serves no purpose, it’s just daydreaming. It legit hurts me at this point
[12/02/2021, 15:59:44] Sam: Wow you just hit me with the whole damn thing 😳
[12/02/2021, 16:00:00] Mr G: It’s really is daydreaming. Absolutely no one has any clue when any of this will be allowed, it’s worse than last year and the gov seems to state every week that it will get worse
[12/02/2021, 16:00:08] Mr G: They don’t have a long term plan
[12/02/2021, 16:00:29] Sam: I’m an optimist
[12/02/2021, 16:01:02] Mr G: Of course that holiday looks awesome
[12/02/2021, 16:01:13] Mr G: But I’ve been hurt too many times for the past months
[12/02/2021, 16:01:17] Sam: I’m clinging to the dream of one day dancing on a beach with a dodgy barman called Pedro, pissed on pina colada
[12/02/2021, 16:01:26] Mr G: 😂
[12/02/2021, 16:01:41] Sam: I’m signing up for it. It WILL happen eventually
[12/02/2021, 16:01:47] Mr G: You know what’s frustrating? Is that you can actually do that right now in loaaaads of places
[12/02/2021, 16:02:09] Mr G: But the gov here is extending this forever and keeping everyone in
[12/02/2021, 16:03:01] Mr G: The only way to have that right now is break the rules and leave the country for 2 weeks. Then risk coming back and not much happening. Anything other than that is just daydreaming
[12/02/2021, 16:03:38] Mr G: I’m sorry but I’m hurt 🥺
[12/02/2021, 16:03:40] Sam: I think this holiday will be delayed to October. But in October I think it will happen
[12/02/2021, 16:03:58] Mr G: The only thing keeping me going was the idea of going on holiday
[12/02/2021, 16:04:13] Sam: I know 🤗
[12/02/2021, 16:04:18] Mr G: But they are shutting that down with no other prospect for the foreseeable future
[12/02/2021, 16:04:57] Mr G: I’ve seen Matt “the cock” Hancock saying that I would get 10 years if I lied about going to portugal 😂
[12/02/2021, 16:05:07] Sam: 😂😂😂
[12/02/2021, 16:05:15] Sam: I’d come visit you in the clink
[12/02/2021, 16:05:17] Mr G: Shits got personal
[12/02/2021, 16:05:25] Sam: Smuggle you in a file in a cake
‎[12/02/2021, 16:05:33] Mr G: ‎sticker omitted
[12/02/2021, 16:05:48] Sam: Have you decided what you’re doing with your AL?
[12/02/2021, 16:06:17] Mr G: I’ll wait until the 22nd maybe until the 8th of March where they might start relaxing things
[12/02/2021, 16:06:26] Mr G: And see if they tighten the rules about going abroad
[12/02/2021, 16:06:30] Sam: I’ve just applied to be a volunteer at a food bank... you might be able to do something like that to get you out of the house?
[12/02/2021, 16:06:33] Mr G: If they do I’ll just stay here
[12/02/2021, 16:06:57] Mr G: What does that entail?
[12/02/2021, 16:07:27] Sam: Or you could do some online tutoring and make a few bucks. There’s bound to be loads of parents that can’t home school and kids that need help with basic maths and English?
[12/02/2021, 16:07:54] Mr G: That would be a good idea actually
[12/02/2021, 16:07:57] Mr G: I’ve done that before
[12/02/2021, 16:08:08] Mr G: Not here though
[12/02/2021, 16:08:14] Sam: Collecting donations, stacking shelves at the food bank, distributing food to people etc
[12/02/2021, 16:11:28] Mr G: Cool! I’ll think about that if I stay here
[12/02/2021, 23:12:24] Mr G: How are you?
[12/02/2021, 23:12:31] Mr G: Feel like haven’t seen you in ages
[12/02/2021, 23:14:25] Sam: I’m good, how are you?
[12/02/2021, 23:14:33] Sam: I know ☹️
[12/02/2021, 23:16:10] Sam: We need to roll it back with a lockdown 1.0 FaceTime-and-wine night
[13/02/2021, 12:00:18] Mr G: Yes
[13/02/2021, 12:00:26] Mr G: Wait weren’t you dry??
[13/02/2021, 12:00:31] Mr G: I’m fine, super bored
[13/02/2021, 12:00:35] Mr G: But doing some stuff
[13/02/2021, 12:04:42] Sam: I am, I have zero alcohol wine!
[13/02/2021, 12:05:31] Sam: Could maybe do coffee tomorrow morning?
[13/02/2021, 12:09:45] Sam: Or free tonight for a FaceTime 😊
[13/02/2021, 13:08:41] Mr G: Ah cant tonight! And can’t guarantee I’ll be alive tomorrow morning 🤣
[13/02/2021, 13:08:45] Mr G: Maybe afternoon ?

[13/02/2021, 13:19:28] Sam: I think I have plans (if I don’t have a v-day induced panic attack and cancel them)
[13/02/2021, 13:19:53] Sam: I miss old trumpy. American news is so boring now 😂
[13/02/2021, 15:04:12] Mr G: 😂 how come?
‎[13/02/2021, 15:13:34] Sam: ‎image omitted
[13/02/2021, 15:16:01] Mr G: 😂
[13/02/2021, 15:16:06] Mr G: Is that the answer ?
[13/02/2021, 15:16:41] Sam: I feel it sums it up 😊😂
[13/02/2021, 15:19:54] Sam: I feel like if you agree to see a guy on v-day, it comes with the expectation that you’re romantically interested in him. And everyone I’ve met lately just feels like I’m “settling”
[13/02/2021, 15:27:23] Sam: But then I think maybe it’s just because I have relationship anxiety issues and don’t give people a chance 🤷🏼‍♀️😂
[13/02/2021, 15:53:14] Mr G: I understand because I can relate a bit 😅 just don’t go with any expectations, just enjoy it for what it is
[13/02/2021, 15:53:38] Mr G: It’s a just nice time in the end!
[13/02/2021, 15:58:34] Sam: But how do you make an exit later on once they already introduced you to their friends/dog/mother?
[13/02/2021, 15:59:04] Mr G: There’s a lot of in between you’re skipping
[13/02/2021, 15:59:15] Mr G: The exit happens there
[13/02/2021, 15:59:18] Mr G: If you want
[13/02/2021, 15:59:40] Mr G: Also getting to know friends after a few weeks is normal I would say?
[13/02/2021, 15:59:49] Mr G: Mother maybe not lol
[13/02/2021, 15:59:54] Mr G: Depends on the vibe
[13/02/2021, 16:01:39] Mr G: When I meet the friends I feel like is just like another night out like I’m meeting randos. But it’s me, I don’t like pda ‘s so everything looks casual on the outside lol
[13/02/2021, 16:02:18] Mr G: Can you relate to any of this or am I wandering off? 😂
[13/02/2021, 16:02:35] Sam: I can relate ☺️
[13/02/2021, 16:02:56] Sam: I just can’t seem to do that without coming across as a total d**k
[13/02/2021, 16:09:24] Sam: Duarte introduced me to his whole family 😂 and my mum doesn’t even know he exists
[13/02/2021, 16:10:00] Mr G: Well... some people have different views lool
[13/02/2021, 16:10:29] Mr G: Also Duarte lives with his family here, I guess they are very present in his life
[13/02/2021, 16:10:33] Mr G: Idk
[13/02/2021, 16:10:48] Sam: I live with my mum 😂
[13/02/2021, 16:10:59] Mr G: I’ve met your mum 😂
[13/02/2021, 16:11:06] Mr G: Shaun and Maz too
[13/02/2021, 16:11:15] Sam: He stayed here and I wiped the cctv so my mum would never know 🤣
[13/02/2021, 16:11:26] Mr G: You have cctv???
[13/02/2021, 16:11:40] Sam: Yeah, we have psycho neighbours
[13/02/2021, 16:11:43] Mr G: Ah yes true
[13/02/2021, 16:11:45] Mr G: Forgot
[13/02/2021, 16:12:02] Mr G: Damn then you caught me stealing when I went there
[13/02/2021, 16:12:23] Sam: Yeah but only after it was established we were in the friendzone
[13/02/2021, 16:12:38] Sam: There’s not much worth stealing 😂
[13/02/2021, 16:13:16] Mr G: Ah ok 😂
[13/02/2021, 16:14:42] Sam: I think I’m just gonna embrace the day tomorrow, take a bubbly bath, throw on my finest lingerie, light some candles... and code 😂
[13/02/2021, 16:15:25] Mr G: 😂😂😂
[13/02/2021, 16:15:35] Mr G: I’m sure there’s an audience for that on twitch
[13/02/2021, 16:15:36] Mr G: Hahaha
[13/02/2021, 16:16:16] Sam: Aren’t you spending the night with Angela? I could make a joke about your python but I’m a lady 😇
[13/02/2021, 16:23:02] Mr G: Oh come on we’re way past that, hit me
‎[13/02/2021, 16:23:04] Mr G: ‎sticker omitted
[13/02/2021, 16:23:15] Mr G: 😂 I’ll do the honours with this sticker
[13/02/2021, 16:24:01] Mr G: But no, I’m done with Angela. It was nice but I’ve had everything I wanted from here. Time to move on and try new things. 
Now I’m with Stephen 🏳️‍🌈
[13/02/2021, 16:25:15] Sam: 😂😂😂😂

[13/02/2021, 16:32:46] Sam: Who the heck is Stephen?!
[13/02/2021, 16:33:12] Mr G: Another teacher from udemy
[13/02/2021, 16:33:19] Mr G: But I’ve stopped with the courses really
[13/02/2021, 16:34:07] Sam: I haven’t done any for a while, the latest uni assignment is intense 😅
[13/02/2021, 16:34:26] Sam: I’ve had to learn pig. Which sounds cute, but it’s not
[13/02/2021, 16:38:00] Mr G: Pig? 😂
[13/02/2021, 16:38:02] Mr G: What is that
[13/02/2021, 16:43:37] Sam: A scripting language for Hadoop
[13/02/2021, 16:44:23] Sam: It’s for my BIG DATA module (I feel like a always need to say that a bit louder)
[13/02/2021, 16:45:05] Mr G: I know , it’s like BIG OIL
[13/02/2021, 16:45:10] Mr G: BIG CORPORATE
[13/02/2021, 16:45:18] Mr G: BIG PHARMA

[14/02/2021, 10:45:18] Sam: 😂😂
[14/02/2021, 10:48:59] Sam: How was last night? Feeling rough?
[14/02/2021, 10:49:13] Mr G: Fairly. Could be worse
[14/02/2021, 10:49:18] Mr G: So
[14/02/2021, 10:49:36] Mr G: Remember my first date a few weeks ago where I said I didn’t make the move despite being sure v
[14/02/2021, 10:49:57] Sam: Yeeeeeah
[14/02/2021, 10:50:21] Mr G: We had our second date
[14/02/2021, 10:50:48] Mr G: Everything was fine , super nice
[14/02/2021, 10:50:58] Mr G: Than she asks what am I looking for on hinge
[14/02/2021, 10:51:22] Sam: Oh I know where this is going 😂
[14/02/2021, 10:51:58] Mr G: And then she says that she is living with her big family which is true, and she will eventually move back to London. So she doesn’t want to risk anything living with her family, doesn’t want to go past having a drink, but she’s having a lovely time and would do it again
[14/02/2021, 10:52:04] Mr G: Talk about mixed signs
[14/02/2021, 10:52:18] Mr G: Now do you understand why I don’t like to make a move
[14/02/2021, 10:52:42] Mr G: We had a really nice time though
[14/02/2021, 10:54:05] Sam: Then see her again? This sounds like she’s just just trying to figure out if you’re only after one thing or not
[14/02/2021, 10:54:57] Mr G: Hmmm
[14/02/2021, 10:55:03] Sam: And she sounds like a nice girl, considering her family and wanting to get to know you before rushing into anything
[14/02/2021, 10:55:04] Mr G: Don’t know I think she was pretty clear
[14/02/2021, 10:55:15] Mr G: But sure
[14/02/2021, 10:55:19] Mr G: I was fine with it
[14/02/2021, 10:55:38] Mr G: I mean, bit sad because I really had a nice first date and I was feeling a connection
[14/02/2021, 10:56:03] Mr G: But after that I just started acting like a friend and conversation got super relaxed
[14/02/2021, 10:56:10] Mr G: Unhinged (pun intended) haha
[14/02/2021, 10:57:29] Sam: Yeah but you can be a friend AND have a connection. The two are not mutually exclusive
[14/02/2021, 10:57:43] Sam: It’s better to get to know someone this way
[14/02/2021, 10:58:52] Mr G: Well
[14/02/2021, 10:59:01] Mr G: I’m not sure I want to have expectations
[14/02/2021, 10:59:12] Mr G: She said that, better like that with no expectations
[14/02/2021, 10:59:19] Mr G: But deffo meet again for another drink
[14/02/2021, 10:59:33] Mr G: I’m pro at having no expectations lol
[14/02/2021, 10:59:47] Sam: Yeah. There’s nothing worse than dating someone for a few months and suddenly the mask starts to slip and you see a whole new side to them
[14/02/2021, 11:00:31] Sam: Better to know who you are upfront. Real you is probably a lot more likeable than “date you” anyway
[14/02/2021, 11:00:41] Mr G: I don’t think I’m managing to pass on the feeling I got from what she said yesterday 😂 I got rejection vibes.
[14/02/2021, 11:00:57] Sam: Why?
[14/02/2021, 11:01:16] Mr G: Why would you go out of your way to say this
[14/02/2021, 11:01:29] Mr G: Otherwise
[14/02/2021, 11:01:57] Sam: Bacause she likes you and wants to be honest?
[14/02/2021, 11:02:28] Mr G: I didn’t get that vibe. But I was drunk
[14/02/2021, 11:02:54] Sam: Well, trust your gut. But I’d say give it another chance
[14/02/2021, 11:03:14] Mr G: We will meet again at some point
[14/02/2021, 11:03:56] Sam: 👍🏼
[14/02/2021, 11:05:33] Sam: Remember, for nice girls, the more they like you, the less they want to sleep with you 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:05:47] Mr G: She said that lol
[14/02/2021, 11:06:17] Mr G: We started talking a lot after that moment 😂 like no shame
[14/02/2021, 11:06:20] Sam: At first anyway 😉
[14/02/2021, 11:09:06] Mr G: Man I give up on understanding
[14/02/2021, 11:09:27] Mr G: I’m sure there’s more to it behind the family thing
[14/02/2021, 11:09:33] Sam: I explained this to you months ago 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:09:34] Mr G: Or maybe not
[14/02/2021, 11:11:49] Sam: Just ask her?
[14/02/2021, 11:12:11] Sam: It’s hard dating people when you live with your family during a pandemic
[14/02/2021, 11:12:50] Sam: You need to explain where you’re going and receive judgment based on how you’re putting your family at risk / being promiscuous / breaking the law 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:13:16] Mr G: Ok but then why are you on hinge v 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:13:20] Sam: It’s like being 15 again 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:13:27] Mr G: And why are you going into this random dudes house
[14/02/2021, 11:13:44] Sam: Because people need love!
[14/02/2021, 11:13:53] Sam: It’s a basic human need to connect with other people
[14/02/2021, 11:14:01] Mr G: Getting as close as sharing food and some drinks and seating close
[14/02/2021, 11:14:11] Sam: Because maybe she thinks you’re nice?
[14/02/2021, 11:14:17] Mr G: Ok, so that’s why it’s a rejection
[14/02/2021, 11:14:35] Mr G: She is just not feeling it
[14/02/2021, 11:14:38] Mr G: Which is fine !
[14/02/2021, 11:14:47] Sam: She literally told you that she was 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:16:09] Mr G: Let me be heartbroken on V-day!!!! 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:16:19] Sam: And if she’d come over and slept with you, would you feel more positive about her feelings for you?
[14/02/2021, 11:16:41] Mr G: Definitely, I mean 😅
[14/02/2021, 11:16:47] Sam: I promise you, the only reason she didn’t sleep with you is because she likes you.
[14/02/2021, 11:17:11] Mr G: I don’t think so. But I’m also not sure
[14/02/2021, 11:17:20] Sam: You’re in the “husband goals” category. Sorry. But you are.
[14/02/2021, 11:17:20] Mr G: She’s showing my picture to her friends. Creep
[14/02/2021, 11:17:25] Mr G: 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:17:33] Sam: 😂😂😂
[14/02/2021, 11:17:53] Mr G: I don’t think she’s feeling it. But who knows
[14/02/2021, 11:18:20] Sam: 😫 I give up. It’s like talking to a brick wall 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:19:02] Sam: Come on, join the single party over here on love day
[14/02/2021, 11:19:03] Mr G: Everything points towards the other way! I need to manage my expectations lol
‎[14/02/2021, 11:19:23] Sam: ‎GIF omitted
[14/02/2021, 11:19:36] Sam: No it doesn’t
[14/02/2021, 11:19:47] Mr G: 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:20:00] Sam: You’re seeing what you want to see
[14/02/2021, 11:21:13] Mr G: She said things like: I’m glad we can clear this out of the way; my friends were asking why are you going on a 2nd date then?!; it’s better like this with no expectations
[14/02/2021, 11:22:08] Mr G: And I took it like a man 😂😂😂
[14/02/2021, 11:22:44] Sam: Would you feel better if she’s said “I told all my friends about you because I really see a future with you. Now take me to the bedroom”???
[14/02/2021, 11:22:52] Mr G: Also if she’s trying to make sure that I’m not dating other woman that’s not a good way to go
[14/02/2021, 11:23:08] Mr G: Ahahah last part definitely wouldn’t happen
[14/02/2021, 11:23:20] Sam: Why?
[14/02/2021, 11:24:18] Mr G: She misunderstood something I said for “you can sleep here if you want”. She was very prompt to say “ I’m not staying over”. And I was like “ oh I wasn’t saying that !!” 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:24:22] Mr G: It was awkward
[14/02/2021, 11:24:41] Mr G: Well...
[14/02/2021, 11:25:12] Sam: She sounds like my kind of girl 😂 date her so I can make friends with her 😬
[14/02/2021, 11:26:32] Mr G: I can’t!! 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:26:45] Mr G: However
[14/02/2021, 11:26:50] Mr G: I like the challenge
[14/02/2021, 11:27:01] Sam: 🤦🏼‍♀️
[14/02/2021, 11:33:00] Mr G: How about you? No date today ?
[14/02/2021, 11:37:17] Sam: No, I think I’m just going to study
[14/02/2021, 11:41:15] Sam: I’ve been texting a guy I used to date in Aberdeen, but he lives in London now. He really liked me but I thought he was too good for me, so I ghosted him 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:43:16] Mr G: 😂
[14/02/2021, 11:43:50] Mr G: But you’re back texting then ?
[14/02/2021, 11:45:02] Sam: Yeah, he found me on Instagram
[14/02/2021, 11:57:45] Mr G: Then you’re not doing a good job in ghosting him anymore 😅
[14/02/2021, 12:00:17] Sam: He was actually a wonderful man. I just made the mistake of googling him
[14/02/2021, 12:01:18] Sam: His family are one of the richest in Scotland. He asked me to go horse riding with him and his mum and literally blocked him from my life 😂
[14/02/2021, 12:01:50] Sam: He sent so many bunches of flowers to my work, I was a total dick about it
[14/02/2021, 12:36:15] Mr G: But why? What’s wrong with that? 😅
[14/02/2021, 12:36:26] Mr G: Was he too posh ?
[14/02/2021, 12:38:05] Mr G: You know my ex gf was from a once one of the wealthiest families back in portugal. They lived in an actual palace 😅 one of the few left in Lisbon from the monarchy times. I found it nice, sometimes bothered me a bit how posh and a bit full of themselves they were. But they were super nice with me anyway.
[14/02/2021, 12:39:04] Mr G: It put me off sometimes.
[14/02/2021, 12:41:02] Sam: He wasn’t posh at all, we got asked to leave the poshest restaurant in Aberdeen on our first date for being too loud 😂
[14/02/2021, 12:41:54] Sam: I just my own insecurities I guess
[14/02/2021, 12:43:16] Sam: His exes were all doctors and barristers. And I was just a little scruffbag who worked offshore in dirty overalls and swore like a sailor 😂
[14/02/2021, 12:53:08] Mr G: ahah
[14/02/2021, 12:53:13] Mr G: well now you have a second chance
[14/02/2021, 12:53:17] Mr G: is he being nice and all
[14/02/2021, 13:02:57] Sam: Yeah he’s being lovely. His face is literally next to the word “gentleman” in the dictionary
[14/02/2021, 16:41:42] Mr G: Go for it!

[15/02/2021, 14:07:17] Sam: Easter bank holiday if (when) snowboarding gets cancelled

[15/02/2021, 17:20:29] Mr G: I’m starting to need a haircut
[15/02/2021, 17:20:36] Mr G: Desperately 😅

[15/02/2021, 17:27:32] Mr G: My hair roots steam from my mental health

[15/02/2021, 17:34:25] Sam: Well I don’t want you throwing yourself off the Tyne bridge because I didn’t get your fade just right 😂
[16/02/2021, 14:14:22] Sam: Did you buy Bitcoin before Christmas?
[16/02/2021, 14:14:46] Mr G: No
[16/02/2021, 14:14:48] Mr G: Why?
[16/02/2021, 14:15:14] Sam: It’s almost doubled
[16/02/2021, 14:15:21] Mr G: I know
[16/02/2021, 14:15:27] Sam: Elon Musk bought a stack of it
[16/02/2021, 14:15:46] Sam: I just bought more last week and it’s gone up again
[16/02/2021, 14:15:59] Mr G: Oh ok nice
[16/02/2021, 14:16:08] Mr G: Yeah I saw it
[16/02/2021, 14:16:59] Sam: My brother has made a killing 😂
[16/02/2021, 14:19:05] Mr G: When did he buy?
[16/02/2021, 14:19:15] Mr G: I sold mine back in may after almost 3 years waiting
[16/02/2021, 14:19:21] Mr G: 😂
[16/02/2021, 14:19:31] Mr G: At 9k
[16/02/2021, 14:19:39] Mr G: Should’ve waited a little longer
[16/02/2021, 14:20:33] Sam: Its 35 now 😅
[16/02/2021, 14:20:52] Sam: I hope Shaun took his own advice

[16/02/2021, 14:23:25] Mr G: Yeah lol
[16/02/2021, 15:17:13] Sam: Are you going to Duarte’s party on Friday?
[16/02/2021, 15:17:33] Mr G: first time Im hearing about that
[16/02/2021, 15:17:37] Mr G: so I guess no xD
[16/02/2021, 15:17:54] Sam: He’s just invited me
[16/02/2021, 15:18:01] Sam: Maybe he hasn’t got round everyone yet
[16/02/2021, 15:18:09] Mr G: is it his bday?
[16/02/2021, 15:18:22] Sam: I can’t imagine I’m very high on the list though 😂
[16/02/2021, 15:24:05] Sam: You’re also the last person I could take as a plus 1 to his birthday 😅😂
[16/02/2021, 15:24:14] Sam: Yeah, I think he’s 31?
[16/02/2021, 15:24:26] Mr G: how come? 😅
[16/02/2021, 15:24:45] Mr G: I refuse to  be 31 this year
[16/02/2021, 15:24:48] Mr G: it's not fair
[16/02/2021, 15:25:13] Mr G: ok Ill rephrase it: I refuse to be 31 this year while outside of the tropics
[16/02/2021, 15:25:34] Sam: Haha I just realised you were the same age 😂
[16/02/2021, 15:39:26] Mr G: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ruJBKFrRCk&ab_channel=SamTabor
[16/02/2021, 15:47:16] Sam: 😂😂😂
[16/02/2021, 15:47:30] Sam: I’m not evening!!!
[16/02/2021, 16:37:00] Sam: Do you still fancy coffee in a bit?
[16/02/2021, 16:42:40] Mr G: Sure
[16/02/2021, 16:42:42] Mr G: Where ?
[16/02/2021, 16:52:33] Sam: Anywhere! Do you want to get out and go for fresh air?
[16/02/2021, 16:53:06] Mr G: Yeah! But not too far away 😅
[16/02/2021, 16:55:00] Sam: We can do the usual? I can drive us to the Italian place?
[16/02/2021, 16:55:26] Mr G: Italian place?
[16/02/2021, 16:57:56] Sam: Near Tyne bar
[16/02/2021, 17:01:01] Mr G: Hmm
[16/02/2021, 17:01:12] Mr G: Do you want to park the car and walk from here ?
[16/02/2021, 17:14:26] Sam: Yeah if you fancy the walk? It’s mild but a little drizzly
[16/02/2021, 17:18:42] Sam: Be there in 5 mins
[16/02/2021, 17:20:58] Mr G: 👌
[16/02/2021, 17:21:35] Sam: I’m outside
[16/02/2021, 17:21:57] Mr G: Ok
[16/02/2021, 18:51:14] Sam: Mamma Julie also says “go for it!”
[16/02/2021, 18:51:57] Sam: We’ll add you to the weekly lasagne and cake distribution list if you’re still unemployed in 6 months 😂
[16/02/2021, 18:52:06] Mr G: 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
[16/02/2021, 18:52:23] Mr G: 😂 thanks feels good to have that support haha
[16/02/2021, 18:53:08] Sam: We believe in you!
[16/02/2021, 19:33:15] Mr G: 😁

[16/02/2021, 21:27:33] Mr G: Purple ish
[16/02/2021, 21:27:58] Sam: Thank god. My lecturer keeps talking about the green line and I thought I’d gone colour blind 😂
[16/02/2021, 21:28:22] Mr G: Maybe it’s outputted differently to him
[16/02/2021, 21:28:24] Sam: There’s not a green line there, is there? Red, blue, burgundy and black?
[16/02/2021, 21:28:43] Sam: Must be 😅
[16/02/2021, 22:05:22] Mr G: https://www.google.pt/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1257966
[16/02/2021, 22:06:57] Sam: 😢🥺😢
[16/02/2021, 23:18:44] Sam: Hooooooooooly fuck
[16/02/2021, 23:19:26] Sam: So Duarte and Vicky are together
[16/02/2021, 23:20:05] Mr G: I suspected that !
[16/02/2021, 23:20:33] Sam: Seriously, are people not aware of the girl code?? Do I need to print it out??
[16/02/2021, 23:20:33] Mr G: Why?
[16/02/2021, 23:20:52] Sam: He just text me saying I should know before Friday so I’m not surprised
[16/02/2021, 23:20:56] Mr G: Hmm I don’t think she knows you’ve been with him 😂
[16/02/2021, 23:21:28] Mr G: But I don’t know I don’t speak with her about those things
[16/02/2021, 23:21:32] Mr G: Does that bother you?
[16/02/2021, 23:21:39] Sam: I just asked him
[16/02/2021, 23:21:43] Sam: He hasn’t told her
[16/02/2021, 23:21:46] Sam: 😂😂😂😂
[16/02/2021, 23:22:39] Sam: I’d be LIVID if I got with a guy and found out later he’d slept with my friend 🙄
[16/02/2021, 23:25:14] Sam: It bothered me that she hadn’t told me. Girl betrayal is waaaaay worse than guy betrayal. But now I know she doesn’t even know, I’m just amused.
[16/02/2021, 23:26:13] Sam: God she can do so much betttttterrrrrrrrr 🙄
[16/02/2021, 23:30:21] Sam: I hope this doesn’t make things weird with vicky, I really like her 🥺
[17/02/2021, 00:02:25] Mr G: it's up to you if she didn't know ;)
[17/02/2021, 00:02:44] Mr G: I mean you ve said that it didn't matter much to you, what you had with him
[17/02/2021, 00:03:52] Mr G: also it's a crap time for dating! haha there arent many options available
[17/02/2021, 00:07:02] Sam: It doesn’t matter to me, but I think it will matter to vicky
[17/02/2021, 00:09:01] Sam: I wouldn’t like to find out the guy I was dating had previously dated my friend. I can see someone getting cut out of this friendship group and it’s probably going to be me ☹️
[17/02/2021, 13:18:21] Mr G: No, I think she’s fine
[17/02/2021, 13:18:27] Mr G: She seems easy going
[17/02/2021, 13:26:23] Sam: Would it not bother you?
[17/02/2021, 13:27:18] Mr G: Well depends on a lot of things
[17/02/2021, 13:27:48] Mr G: But if it was something not very serious
[17/02/2021, 13:27:59] Mr G: And it had a fair time frame
[17/02/2021, 13:28:05] Mr G: In between
[17/02/2021, 13:28:13] Mr G: I guess not
[17/02/2021, 13:29:06] Sam: Is 3 months a fair time frame?
[17/02/2021, 13:29:20] Sam: In a lockdown?
[17/02/2021, 13:29:45] Sam: I still have stuff at his house I haven’t picked it up 🥺
[17/02/2021, 13:30:48] Mr G: It is cmon. I mean if things are independent, not like jump from one to another 😂
[17/02/2021, 13:30:57] Mr G: But if feelings are involved is different !
[17/02/2021, 13:31:31] Sam: Okay,  you’re a guy. Maybe you don’t understand
[17/02/2021, 13:32:20] Mr G: Why is it different? 😂
[17/02/2021, 13:33:13] Sam: A little empathy wouldn’t kill you dude
[17/02/2021, 13:33:15] Sam: I’m sad
[17/02/2021, 13:33:19] Sam: Jeeeeze
[17/02/2021, 13:39:04] Mr G: So are you bothered?
[17/02/2021, 13:39:13] Mr G: You said you weren’t
[17/02/2021, 13:39:23] Mr G: Also don’t be sexist then 😠
[17/02/2021, 13:40:12] Mr G: I understand! It’s a touchy subject
[17/02/2021, 13:40:36] Mr G: But you described things as not too important
[17/02/2021, 13:40:56] Mr G: I just thought it wouldn’t be but maybe they are
[17/02/2021, 13:42:05] Sam: It’s fine, I’m just not emotionally black and white like you (metaphorically, I’m not being racist as well as sexist)
[17/02/2021, 13:45:04] Sam: Yeah he wasn’t the love of my life but he was literally the only guy I’ve even kissed apart from Ami in like 3 years, so I’m not going to say he meant absolutely nothing to me. I love having him as my friend and in my life, he’s basically the reason I’m in this new role and back at uni. And it makes me sad that, if vicky reacts the way I would react, that’s going to change
[17/02/2021, 14:17:42] Mr G: I’m also not saying is totally fine. I know it’s a touchy subject and it would probably bother me, depending on the situation. I think it’s normal to bother I just thought it didn’t mean as much as that to you.
[17/02/2021, 14:18:38] Mr G: And also that she seems to be fairly easygoing so I don’t think it will bother, but I don’t know.
[17/02/2021, 14:22:24] Mr G: It’s not about empathy I honestly thought it didn’t bother you! But I can see how it does
[17/02/2021, 14:22:40] Mr G: Anyway, don’t think about it too much
[17/02/2021, 14:22:44] Mr G: There’s no point

[18/02/2021, 10:15:44] Mr G: NOW
[18/02/2021, 10:15:51] Sam: It even has this little drawer for the pen I keep losing in my bed and stabbing/drawing on myself 😂
[18/02/2021, 10:15:51] Mr G: idc if I need it
[18/02/2021, 10:16:01] Sam: Oh you NEED IT
[18/02/2021, 10:16:01] Mr G: I need to store things on that little drawer

[18/02/2021, 10:16:49] Mr G: 😂
[18/02/2021, 11:57:49] Sam: Yeahhh so vicky did know and just didn’t know how to tell me
[18/02/2021, 11:58:32] Sam: What is it with 90% of the dance community being born without a moral compass? 🤦🏼‍♀️
[18/02/2021, 14:38:10] Mr G: Did she know before ?
[18/02/2021, 15:00:30] Sam: Yeah, she was looking forward to seeing me on Friday and relieved that I wasn’t mad at her because she hadn’t known how to tell me
[18/02/2021, 15:01:40] Sam: Needless to say, I’m not going on Friday 😂
[18/02/2021, 15:17:45] Mr G: Are you then?
[18/02/2021, 15:17:48] Mr G: Mad at her
[18/02/2021, 15:18:16] Sam: Disappointed
[18/02/2021, 15:25:19] Sam: And just sick of fake friends
[18/02/2021, 15:28:40] Mr G: Did you consider her a good friend?
[18/02/2021, 15:29:59] Sam: Yeah. I was literally telling Jayne last week how nice she was and how much I was looking forward to hanging out with her after lockdown 🙄
[18/02/2021, 15:49:15] Mr G: :/
[18/02/2021, 15:49:34] Mr G: If it makes you happy, I’m still considering you cutting my hair
[18/02/2021, 15:49:38] Mr G: But only considering

[18/02/2021, 21:43:30] Sam: Postponed till next year. As expected. I didn’t even bother waxing my board this year, it was never gonna happen 😂

[18/02/2021, 21:45:45] Sam: Yeah or I can keep it for next year and guarantee a place
[18/02/2021, 21:46:22] Sam: All the places went in an hour this year, so I’ll probably leave my deposit where it is
[18/02/2021, 21:46:52] Mr G: Cute 😂
[18/02/2021, 21:47:00] Sam: I’ve just wrote my first Apache pig scheme all by myself 😁 it’s only taken 9 hours 😂
[18/02/2021, 21:47:29] Sam: Nothing is bringing me down tonight buddy, not even your sarcasm 😛
[18/02/2021, 21:48:47] Mr G: I love that language name! What is it for?
[18/02/2021, 21:50:09] Mr G: It’s just that I don’t believe there will be a “next year”. The whole world is still not progressing the stages of grief 😂
[18/02/2021, 21:50:56] Sam: One day, it’s gonna happen
[18/02/2021, 21:51:05] Sam: There will be pints in a beer garden again
[18/02/2021, 21:51:09] Sam: There WILL

[18/02/2021, 21:51:18] Mr G: Ahah
[18/02/2021, 21:53:26] Sam: Kinda just like the street ambiance. Makes me feel like I’m working from a cafe in Paris or something
[18/02/2021, 21:53:42] Sam: Had my appraisal today
[18/02/2021, 21:58:47] Mr G: And??
[18/02/2021, 21:59:30] Sam: My boss wants me to start “transitioning into a leadership role” 😭😭
[18/02/2021, 22:00:00] Mr G: That’s awesome no?
[18/02/2021, 22:00:27] Sam: My aspirations died many years ago, just let me take my money and leave at 4:40 😂
[19/02/2021, 10:04:05] Mr G: Sooo
[19/02/2021, 10:04:31] Mr G: Do you have any sort of an idea for the design of your portfolio? Or are you open to recommendations ?
[19/02/2021, 10:14:48] Sam: I am completely in your capable hands 😊 the last time I even updated my CV was about 8 years ago 😂
[19/02/2021, 10:32:31] Mr G: Loool ok
[19/02/2021, 10:32:40] Mr G: Do you have a list of the things you want to put there ?
[19/02/2021, 13:36:28] Sam: Not yet but I’ll have a think tonight 😊

[19/02/2021, 14:03:22] Sam: And it’s an automatic 😅
[19/02/2021, 14:03:21] Mr G: How?
[19/02/2021, 14:03:28] Mr G: You spelled right wrong 😂
[19/02/2021, 14:03:46] Mr G: That makes things easier
[19/02/2021, 14:03:53] Mr G: Because gears are not mirrored
[19/02/2021, 14:03:56] Sam: 90% of the cars we build are for Europe, so all the cars for nipping around site are the WRONG way round
[19/02/2021, 14:04:04] Mr G: Are you driving?
[19/02/2021, 14:04:14] Sam: I’ve just pulled up
[19/02/2021, 14:04:18] Sam: It’s like a go-kart
[19/02/2021, 14:04:48] Sam: Luckily we’re capped at 10mph so I can’t do too much damage 😂

[20/02/2021, 15:51:24] Mr G: You’re going deeper on the niche of ambience sound 😂
[20/02/2021, 16:09:27] Sam: It really tricks your brain. I left it on last night and when I came back in my room there were birds birds tweeting at 10pm, I got so confused 😂
[20/02/2021, 16:10:22] Sam: After living on a boat for so long, nothing chills me out like engine noise and seagulls 🤷🏼‍♀️
[21/02/2021, 01:29:20] Mr G: Haha I’ll try that
[21/02/2021, 01:29:37] Mr G: It’s legit meditation sounds

[21/02/2021, 17:42:25] Sam: The column “is_retweet” shows 1.0 if the text is a retweet. 

I need to know how many times each of the users in column “user_name” has retweeted something
[21/02/2021, 17:43:24] Sam: I’m trying to figure out who the top users are
[21/02/2021, 17:43:44] Sam: But also having a mini-mental breakdown 🙂

[21/02/2021, 17:44:56] Mr G: Vanila python or some library?
[21/02/2021, 17:44:59] Sam: I need a hug so bad right now, please just be nice to me
[21/02/2021, 17:45:24] Sam: I’m actually using spark with zeppelin but it understands python
[21/02/2021, 17:45:46] Mr G: I don’t know any of those 😅
[21/02/2021, 17:45:53] Mr G: To do that
[21/02/2021, 17:46:05] Mr G: There are options
[21/02/2021, 17:46:21] Mr G: For example pandas I think does it fairly easil
[21/02/2021, 17:46:25] Mr G: Easily
[21/02/2021, 17:46:28] Mr G: Can you use pandas?
[21/02/2021, 17:47:13] Sam: I don’t think so, I don’t think we can use any libraries 

I’m thinking I need to assign columns, decide if true or false based on 1.0 or 0.0 in the
[21/02/2021, 17:47:22] Mr G: Ah
[21/02/2021, 17:47:28] Mr G: So basic python ?
[21/02/2021, 17:47:35] Mr G: Like raw code?
[21/02/2021, 17:47:53] Sam: Is_retweet column... but I don’t know how to connect it to the username and return a count
[21/02/2021, 17:48:01] Sam: Yes
[21/02/2021, 17:48:08] Mr G: Ok first things first
[21/02/2021, 17:48:16] Mr G: How are you importing the csv data ?
[21/02/2021, 17:49:02] Sam: It’s not csv, it’s a text file uploaded from my sandbox to zeppelin
[21/02/2021, 17:49:18] Mr G: But what you sent me was a csv
[21/02/2021, 17:50:54] Sam: That’s just a teeeeeny snippet of my dataset. I converted the main file to a txt.
[21/02/2021, 17:51:06] Mr G: Ok
[21/02/2021, 17:51:12] Mr G: So how does your code receive the data?
[21/02/2021, 17:51:21] Mr G: How does your python store that table?
‎[21/02/2021, 17:51:56] Sam: ‎image omitted
[21/02/2021, 17:53:29] Mr G: Pyspark
[21/02/2021, 17:53:37] Sam: Yes
[21/02/2021, 17:53:47] Mr G: .take() seems like a method from pyspark
[21/02/2021, 17:54:07] Mr G: Which is something I don’t really know lool but seems like a dataset. Lines seems to be a table
[21/02/2021, 17:54:13] Mr G: Can you access rows and columns ?
[21/02/2021, 17:54:17] Sam: It’s a table
[21/02/2021, 17:54:19] Sam: Yes
[21/02/2021, 17:54:37] Sam: Separated by commas
[21/02/2021, 17:54:37] Mr G: How can you access for example user_name from line 4
[21/02/2021, 17:55:08] Sam: That’s the bit I’m stuck with
[21/02/2021, 17:55:14] Mr G: Hmm
[21/02/2021, 17:56:20] Sam: I need to add up how many times a username appears AND had a 1.0 in the is_retweet column
[21/02/2021, 17:56:34] Sam: Maybe an if statement?
[21/02/2021, 17:57:56] Sam: If username has 1.0 in “is_retweet” column, increase output count by 1? But how do I go through the list row by row?
[21/02/2021, 17:57:58] Mr G: Well this is how I would tackle the logic:
1. Get the list of the user_names: run a for loop to every line and get a list of all the unique user_names (if it repeats, skip it, if it isn’t on your list yet, add it)

2. Go through that list of each username, run a for loop for each of them, and compile a list by checking out of all the lines that have that username, if it has a retweet
[21/02/2021, 17:58:37] Sam: That’s what I was thinking but more eloquent 😂
[21/02/2021, 17:58:45] Mr G: The problem is that you seem to be  taking this small snippet out of the context, and my help might be considering a different approach from what you pretend in the end
[21/02/2021, 17:58:55] Mr G: Because I don’t know those libraries/frameworks
[21/02/2021, 17:59:01] Mr G: Ok you can simplify
[21/02/2021, 17:59:03] Mr G: Wait
[21/02/2021, 17:59:15] Mr G: You can just run one for loop
[21/02/2021, 17:59:21] Mr G: That compiles 2 lists
‎[21/02/2021, 18:00:32] Sam: ‎image omitted
[21/02/2021, 18:01:00] Sam: I’ve been on this assignment for 38.3 hours and I’m not even halfway through 😫
[21/02/2021, 18:02:02] Mr G: So if the user doesn’t exist on your list (there’s an easy method for that), add to the first list(user name list), and if there’s a retweet, count it on the second list (no. Of retweets, on the same index of the first list). In the case that you’re adding in for the first time on the list (a new username you just found out) it can either have 1 retweet or 0 retweets.
If that username already exists on the list, you check if it’s a retweet, and if is, second list on the same index of the username on the first, count=count+1
[21/02/2021, 18:02:20] Mr G: In the end you should have 2 lists with all the unique usernames and how many retweets each has
[21/02/2021, 18:04:39] Sam: I should have listened to Angela

[21/02/2021, 18:06:13] Mr G: But I’d be using mock up lists lol
[21/02/2021, 18:07:31] Mr G: Or I can use the csv you sent me

[21/02/2021, 18:11:34] Sam: I notice my tutor just increased my virtual computer time by 50 hours which doesn’t fill me with fuzzy feelings for how long this is going to take me 😂
[21/02/2021, 18:11:40] Mr G: You’ll probably need to adapt it to your code

[21/02/2021, 18:35:48] Mr G: I’m writing this in vanilla python. There are more efficient methods in pandas (which is the only data analysis library I know) and I’m sure there are on the libraries you are using
[21/02/2021, 18:36:02] Mr G: But since they are different I will just write these loops
[21/02/2021, 18:50:08] Mr G: Ok so I think I’ve got it
[21/02/2021, 18:50:25] Mr G: Either I’m doing something wrong or each user has maximum one retweet from the list you sent me

[22/02/2021, 16:44:00] Mr G: He mentioned that they are assessing holiday booking by April
[22/02/2021, 16:44:07] Mr G: Anything before that is just still dreaming
[22/02/2021, 16:44:15] Mr G: Or don’t 😂

[22/02/2021, 16:45:14] Sam: I just got a voicemail from bachakizzz, they’re not giving refunds till April now
[22/02/2021, 16:45:38] Mr G: I didn’t listen to it fully but he didn’t mention travel restrictions. Because the new variants are still a risk
[22/02/2021, 16:45:48] Mr G: I think there will be problems with that even after June
[22/02/2021, 16:46:20] Sam: I’m thinking October / November

[23/02/2021, 11:54:01] Sam: Awful. I realised I used the wrong delimiter on my pig scrips and now I have to go back to the start and do it all again
[23/02/2021, 11:54:11] Sam: Absolutely screwed by a comma
[23/02/2021, 11:54:50] Sam: It feels like one step forward, two steps back

[24/02/2021, 00:12:43] Sam: Did you hear about tiger woods?

[25/02/2021, 16:27:07] Mr G: I can imagine cancelled?
[25/02/2021, 16:27:13] Sam: I think I’m responsible for about 50% of your slang vocabulary
[25/02/2021, 16:27:24] Mr G: probably more
[25/02/2021, 16:27:29] Sam: Yes, cancelled/ruined
[25/02/2021, 16:27:29] Mr G: why aye man

[25/02/2021, 16:27:39] Mr G: what happened?
[25/02/2021, 16:28:01] Sam: I’ll just be working on getting my assignment perfect instead of fraternising
[25/02/2021, 16:28:30] Mr G: that was intentional 😂
[25/02/2021, 16:28:39] Sam: 😉
[25/02/2021, 16:28:45] Mr G: haha
[25/02/2021, 16:28:58] Mr G: fortunately is the same
[25/02/2021, 16:29:21] Mr G: when are we going for a coffee? next week?
[25/02/2021, 16:30:43] Sam: Whenever you’re free, I might be going horse riding at some point (don’t ask 😂) and working on the house but probably free in the afternoons this weekend
[25/02/2021, 16:30:58] Sam: Or free next week apart from Wednesday
[25/02/2021, 16:31:22] Mr G: 😂
[25/02/2021, 16:31:24] Mr G: where?
[25/02/2021, 16:31:38] Sam: My friend Immy’s farm
[25/02/2021, 16:32:01] Mr G: classic Immy
[25/02/2021, 16:33:28] Sam: I told her about John and she googled him (we really need to stop doing that 😂) and it turns out his family own a stud farm. So so she’s taking on the challenge of trying to teach me how to ride on the sly so I’m not a total noob
[25/02/2021, 16:33:56] Sam: I can actually ride a horse but I haven’t done it for years and I think I have the fear now 😂
[25/02/2021, 16:34:52] Mr G: 😂😂
[25/02/2021, 16:34:59] Mr G: oh so that's the aberdeen guy?
[25/02/2021, 16:35:13] Sam: Yeah

[25/02/2021, 16:36:23] Sam: I haven’t worn anything but sweatpants for months, I’m not ready for makeup and actual EFFORT
[25/02/2021, 16:37:04] Mr G: hahahah
[25/02/2021, 16:37:12] Mr G: let me know how he dresses up
[25/02/2021, 16:37:25] Mr G: because I haven't done any effort whatsoever lately xD
[25/02/2021, 16:38:27] Sam: Well I’ve never ever ever seen him in anything but a suit, so I’m interested to see what his definition of “dressing down” looks like
[25/02/2021, 16:38:37] Mr G: oh wow
[25/02/2021, 16:38:48] Mr G: even during these times
[25/02/2021, 16:39:15] Sam: It was actually one of the things that freaked me out about him... I couldn’t imagine sitting in a pub next to him in jeans (and I like that stuff)
[25/02/2021, 16:39:56] Sam: Well I haven’t seen him for about 8 years, so god knows what he looks like now
[25/02/2021, 16:40:25] Sam: He’s still been working full time, so he’s in business-mode every day
[25/02/2021, 17:39:05] Mr G: Maybe he aged like wine let’s see
[25/02/2021, 17:39:42] Mr G: Remember that girl that friendzoned me ?

[25/02/2021, 18:50:56] Sam: I think the universe threw me a millionaire at just the right time 😂
[25/02/2021, 18:51:10] Sam: Yeah, you’re getting laid my friend 🤷🏼‍♀️
[25/02/2021, 18:51:10] Mr G: So no thesis ends up with me having sex
[25/02/2021, 18:51:29] Mr G: Hahaha
[25/02/2021, 18:51:43] Mr G: Can I horse ride when you own a farm ?
[25/02/2021, 18:51:50] Sam: Time to trim your toenails and floss
[25/02/2021, 18:51:52] Sam: No
[25/02/2021, 18:51:55] Mr G: Platonically

[25/02/2021, 19:17:18] Sam: I feel like I was trying to get in your pants for about 6 months though and you were pretty clueless about it so this poor lassy has her work cut out 😂
[25/02/2021, 19:23:32] Mr G: 😂
[25/02/2021, 19:23:36] Mr G: There’s a big difference
[25/02/2021, 19:24:02] Mr G: She straight out said that doesn’t want anything
[25/02/2021, 19:24:51] Mr G: If you’re really right then fuck, how confusing can it get 😂
[25/02/2021, 19:25:19] Sam: Nah, she just wants you to think she’s a lady 😂
[25/02/2021, 19:25:53] Mr G: You say these things like you know her 😂 but you sound so convincing I’m tempted to be influenced
[25/02/2021, 19:26:00] Sam: It’s a test, if you’re still happy hanging out with her when she said she doesn’t want anything, she’s checking to see if you like her for more than a booty call
[25/02/2021, 19:26:13] Sam: I’ve done it 🤷🏼‍♀️
[25/02/2021, 19:26:20] Mr G: Ah I was going to ask you that

[26/02/2021, 10:13:31] Mr G: Are you considering it??
[26/02/2021, 10:13:43] Sam: No
[26/02/2021, 10:13:50] Sam: They’re paying for uni
[26/02/2021, 10:13:53] Mr G: Can I take it?
[26/02/2021, 10:13:58] Mr G: Yes true
[26/02/2021, 10:14:01] Sam: That’s worth 20k
[26/02/2021, 10:14:33] Sam: We have to get rid of nearly 1/4 of our engineers
[26/02/2021, 10:15:07] Sam: And they’re mostly coming from new model team (chloes team)
[26/02/2021, 10:15:21] Mr G: Do you think she’ll take it ?
[26/02/2021, 10:15:33] Mr G: I forgot she worked there too lol
[26/02/2021, 10:15:38] Sam: Maybe
[26/02/2021, 10:15:45] Sam: She’s been there about 6 years
[26/02/2021, 10:16:14] Sam: I think there’s a chance she’ll get compulsory redundancy if she doesn’t take voluntary first
[26/02/2021, 10:17:09] Sam: They left her on furlough a month after everyone in her team came back to work
[26/02/2021, 11:19:09] Sam: They’re up to the 40-49 age group for the injection already 😯 it’s going to be our turn next 👏🏼

[09/03/2021, 09:25:02] Sam: And now all the guys are acting like he’s been hiding some awful secret or something. I’m literally SHOOK.
[09/03/2021, 09:56:15] Mr G: Who’s hiding?
[09/03/2021, 09:57:18] Sam: The guy down on the shop floor. They just found out he’s gay but they’ve worked with him for years

[11/03/2021, 13:54:38] Mr G: Maybe as what he represents
[11/03/2021, 13:54:45] Sam: It’s okay if you just like him for his looks
[11/03/2021, 13:55:02] Mr G: They are fading though

[11/03/2021, 13:57:52] Mr G: They’re all from Argélia and Senegal 😂
[11/03/2021, 13:58:35] Sam: Japanese men are generally not genetically pre-disposed to being 7 foot tall and 3 foot wide
[11/03/2021, 13:58:52] Sam: It’s amazing how creative they can be with their family tree

[12/03/2021, 12:11:59] Sam: Where is the embassy?
[12/03/2021, 12:12:04] Mr G: London
[12/03/2021, 12:12:13] Mr G: This is the consulate
[12/03/2021, 12:12:22] Mr G: I’m not sure what’s the difference
[12/03/2021, 12:12:25] Sam: Oh
[12/03/2021, 12:13:00] Mr G: I think an embassy is an actual piece of the country
[12/03/2021, 12:13:10] Mr G: Whereas a consulate is just for the services
[12/03/2021, 12:36:14] Sam: When is your appointment?
[12/03/2021, 12:36:23] Mr G: 1h ago
[12/03/2021, 12:36:39] Mr G: I was 30 mins late, but thankfully everything is even more delayed here
[12/03/2021, 12:36:41] Mr G: Classic 😂
[12/03/2021, 12:36:44] Sam: That was quick!
[12/03/2021, 12:36:51] Mr G: No you don’t get it
[12/03/2021, 12:36:57] Mr G: I’m still waiting
[12/03/2021, 12:37:12] Sam: Oh you still haven’t been in
[12/03/2021, 12:37:19] Sam: With you now
[12/03/2021, 12:37:26] Sam: My brain is mush today
[12/03/2021, 12:37:43] Mr G: Haha it’s Friday, no worries!
[12/03/2021, 12:37:47] Mr G: What are you up to today?
[12/03/2021, 12:38:12] Sam: Finishing work soon then going to pick up my new boxing gloves
[12/03/2021, 12:38:32] Sam: Then training with Jayne tonight. We’re exchanging boxing skills for bachata skills
[12/03/2021, 12:38:32] Mr G: I’m told it’s courtesy here to query about plans for the weekend
[12/03/2021, 12:38:42] Sam: 😂😂
[12/03/2021, 12:38:49] Mr G: Oh wow!! That’s an interesting combination haha
[12/03/2021, 12:38:52] Mr G: But sounds fun!!
[12/03/2021, 12:38:59] Sam: You’re learning all that British etiquette
[12/03/2021, 12:39:17] Mr G: Are you going to integrate boxing moves in a bachata routine? 😂 imagine
[12/03/2021, 12:39:27] Sam: Yeah she’s a pretty decent boxer despite being about 4 foot tall 😂
[12/03/2021, 12:39:43] Sam: I feel like I already do that when the guy is creepy 😂
[12/03/2021, 12:39:57] Mr G: The weather is crap today is it not
[12/03/2021, 12:40:17] Mr G: That’s the right height to compete with men 😂
[12/03/2021, 12:41:05] Sam: 😂😂 it’s okay here, bit breezy, good weather for getting the washing on the line 🇬🇧
[12/03/2021, 12:41:20] Sam: She’d just punch them in the wang and run
[12/03/2021, 12:41:31] Mr G: Wang 🤣
[12/03/2021, 12:41:58] Mr G: It’s actually quite a nice day here
[12/03/2021, 12:42:04] Mr G: I think I’ll go for a walk maybe
[12/03/2021, 12:42:41] Sam: I used to ride my bmx around the northern quarter and ancoats for hours
[12/03/2021, 12:42:45] Sam: It’s nice up there
[12/03/2021, 12:43:22] Mr G: How can something as simple as picking up a document take this much time
[12/03/2021, 12:43:42] Sam: 🤷🏼‍♀️
[12/03/2021, 12:43:49] Sam: What’s your plan for tonight?
[12/03/2021, 12:43:59] Mr G: Hummm
[12/03/2021, 12:44:09] Mr G: 😬
[12/03/2021, 13:31:59] Mr G: The apartment is massive!!!
[12/03/2021, 14:40:18] Sam: Just had the guys I sit next to at work ask me what they can do to be better in light of this last in London being murdered ❤️
[12/03/2021, 14:41:09] Sam: Light how to act around women in the street or at night to help them feel less threatened
[12/03/2021, 14:56:28] Mr G: And what did you say?
[12/03/2021, 14:57:30] Mr G: Any suggestions for places to go here?

[14/03/2021, 11:02:35] Sam: On a date?
[14/03/2021, 11:03:45] Mr G: Kinda
[14/03/2021, 11:05:25] Sam: Oh
[14/03/2021, 11:06:15] Sam: In that case, the north east coast of England is crap and you probably shouldn’t waste your time 👍🏼
[14/03/2021, 11:06:37] Mr G: What? 😅
[14/03/2021, 11:07:08] Sam: Seriously

[14/03/2021, 14:51:05] Sam: I don’t think so
[14/03/2021, 14:56:21] Mr G: ?
[14/03/2021, 18:36:51] Mr G: Come on
[14/03/2021, 19:06:02] Sam: I think I’m just tired, I didn’t sleep very well last night. The neighbours are back to their old tricks again and it’s freaking me out
[14/03/2021, 19:07:14] Mr G: I’m sorry about that
[14/03/2021, 19:08:05] Mr G: But what’s happening in your head?
[14/03/2021, 19:18:09] Sam: I just felt like (and I understand it didn’t mean as much to you) the day we went to the beach where I grew up last year was a really nice memory for me and the last “normal” day before covid craziness. I know I don’t have dibsys on Northumberland, and I’m fine giving you advice when it comes to dates and stuff because I just really want you to be happy. But it just made me feel a bit... Replaceable? Jealous? I don’t know 🤷🏼‍♀️
[14/03/2021, 19:18:46] Sam: Sorry ☹️
[14/03/2021, 20:38:17] Mr G: I understand! But at the same time I don’t agree
[14/03/2021, 20:38:43] Mr G: That was such a fun day and it was not replaceable
[14/03/2021, 20:38:47] Mr G: But I can see your pov
[14/03/2021, 20:42:15] Mr G: Don’t worry though, there’s definitely nothing going on here
[14/03/2021, 20:46:43] Sam: Maybe so, but eventually it will with someone
[14/03/2021, 21:29:19] Mr G: Does that idea affect you?

[14/03/2021, 22:14:19] Mr G: I’m a bit down today
[14/03/2021, 22:14:39] Mr G: So I don’t think I can continue this convo
[14/03/2021, 22:15:25] Mr G: Or maybe we shouldn’t have this convo lol
[14/03/2021, 22:16:16] Mr G: I think I decided
[14/03/2021, 22:16:46] Mr G: And I really want to have a haircut, botched or not.
[14/03/2021, 22:16:53] Sam: Dude you asked... I’d rather never discuss feelings and just let it die 😂
[14/03/2021, 22:17:49] Sam: Push them down, deep deep down inside. Like a true British person
[14/03/2021, 22:18:26] Sam: Hurrahhh
[14/03/2021, 22:19:55] Sam: We don’t need to talk about it but I hope you’re okay 🤗 zaps snugs 🤗

[15/03/2021, 09:00:26] Sam: Because it’s FO SHO gonna get cancelled

[15/03/2021, 09:37:28] Sam: It’s like a lil ‘fro
[15/03/2021, 09:37:44] Mr G: I just put it out
[15/03/2021, 09:42:27] Mr G: I just realised that clippers aren’t scissors 😂
[15/03/2021, 09:42:38] Mr G: You were going to kill me!!
[15/03/2021, 09:43:21] Sam: I wasn’t! 🥺
[15/03/2021, 09:43:32] Sam: Just a lil trim
[15/03/2021, 09:43:40] Mr G: I don’t even care anymore. Clippers or not clippers

[15/03/2021, 22:30:47] Sam: Yes
[15/03/2021, 22:30:47] Mr G: Is this considered cheating ?
[15/03/2021, 22:30:53] Sam: I don’t know!

[15/03/2021, 22:46:12] Mr G: But weird
[15/03/2021, 22:46:36] Mr G: How does she feel about it ?
[15/03/2021, 22:50:32] Sam: I dunno, we’ve kissed goodbye on the mouth for yeeeears. But something has definitely changed lately
[15/03/2021, 22:51:08] Sam: It was like that scene from ghost with a punchbag instead of a pottery wheel 😂

[15/03/2021, 22:53:05] Mr G: It’s very simple
[15/03/2021, 22:53:22] Mr G: If it’s something she could tell to her boyfriend then it’s not cheating
[15/03/2021, 22:53:52] Sam: I think she’s staying over this weekend
[15/03/2021, 22:54:04] Mr G: Over where 😂

[15/03/2021, 22:54:51] Sam: It’s her birthday
[15/03/2021, 22:55:01] Mr G: Just have fun
[15/03/2021, 22:55:04] Sam: And her boyfriend is useless and hasn’t even planned anything
[15/03/2021, 22:55:11] Mr G: Dont do anything you feel it isn’t right
[15/03/2021, 22:55:43] Mr G: Ok but that doesn’t justify everything 😅
[15/03/2021, 22:56:00] Sam: 😬
[15/03/2021, 22:56:14] Mr G: But my opinion is
[15/03/2021, 22:56:16] Mr G: Have fun
[15/03/2021, 22:56:34] Sam: That’s why I come to you for the good advice 😬
[15/03/2021, 22:59:23] Mr G: Ayyyy
[15/03/2021, 22:59:28] Mr G: It’s her decision
[15/03/2021, 22:59:33] Mr G: Not your relationship
[15/03/2021, 22:59:40] Mr G: Take a camera just in case btw
[15/03/2021, 22:59:44] Mr G: 🤣🤣🤣
[15/03/2021, 22:59:46] Mr G: Jk
[15/03/2021, 23:00:39] Sam: I think our friendship is a different thing entirely. We’ve loved each other for 20 years!
[15/03/2021, 23:01:49] Sam: It not weird at all and it wouldn’t be a big deal
[15/03/2021, 23:02:11] Sam: I was waiting for this comment 🙄😂
[15/03/2021, 23:02:35] Sam: Just two friends helping each other out 😅😂😂
[15/03/2021, 23:02:52] Mr G: My lawyers helped me with the wording of this joke
[15/03/2021, 23:03:04] Mr G: I know!
[15/03/2021, 23:03:07] Mr G: It’s ok
[15/03/2021, 23:03:11] Mr G: No big deal
[15/03/2021, 23:04:36] Sam: No biggie ✌🏼

[16/03/2021, 10:14:04] Sam: Corona cockblock 😂😂😂
[16/03/2021, 10:14:08] Sam: I love this actually
[16/03/2021, 10:14:12] Sam: I might do this
‎[16/03/2021, 10:15:35] Sam: ‎image omitted
[16/03/2021, 10:15:50] Sam: Also this is my favourite quote
[16/03/2021, 10:16:09] Sam: I didn’t even know data is beautiful was a thing! ❤️
[16/03/2021, 10:24:29] Mr G: I was thinking the same xD
[16/03/2021, 10:25:00] Mr G: damn that second one
[16/03/2021, 10:25:31] Sam: I’m scared how traumatic it’s going to be 🙈 I think it might be good for me though
[16/03/2021, 10:25:44] Sam: 100% true 👌🏼
[16/03/2021, 10:26:33] Sam: What application do you think she used?
‎[16/03/2021, 10:27:59] Sam: ‎image omitted
[16/03/2021, 10:31:38] Mr G: Google calendar with excel and PowerPoint lol
[16/03/2021, 10:31:42] Mr G: It’s in the comments
[16/03/2021, 10:32:02] Mr G: Ah yes
[16/03/2021, 10:32:08] Mr G: This seems very doable on excel
[16/03/2021, 10:32:34] Mr G: I think I can get my history until my relationship, but before that...
[16/03/2021, 10:32:37] Mr G: Hard to remember
[16/03/2021, 10:32:56] Sam: I think I’ve subconsciously blocked out about half of it
[16/03/2021, 10:33:12] Mr G: I was on Erasmus when I met her, I remember the months before 😂
[16/03/2021, 10:33:15] Mr G: But that’s it
[16/03/2021, 10:33:43] Sam: I think the fact even thinking about doing this is making me feel ill means I should probably do it 😂
[16/03/2021, 10:33:55] Mr G: Lol
[16/03/2021, 10:34:12] Mr G: Your hookups, dates and exes will have one last time to shine
[16/03/2021, 10:34:25] Mr G: And be remembered
[16/03/2021, 10:34:33] Sam: A lot of them should be buried in the ground
[16/03/2021, 10:34:39] Sam: One of them actually is
[16/03/2021, 10:34:43] Sam: 😳
[16/03/2021, 10:34:46] Mr G: Oh
[16/03/2021, 10:34:48] Mr G: How come?
[16/03/2021, 10:35:01] Sam: Meningitis
[16/03/2021, 10:36:33] Sam: I’m gonna do it 💪🏼
[16/03/2021, 10:37:51] Mr G: Damn that’s sad !
[16/03/2021, 10:38:53] Sam: Yeah, I had to repeat my final year of high school after that
[16/03/2021, 10:43:26] Mr G: Here’s a song for you… I Need U by Jeremy Blake
https://open.spotify.com/track/1H1tP1DDC34WxRzvdUj3lf?si=JmyVPhVIRKiaEsGtUZRVVw
[16/03/2021, 10:43:42] Mr G: That sucks, sorry for that :/ I thought it was after you dated
[16/03/2021, 10:43:49] Mr G: The song from the op-1
[16/03/2021, 10:43:57] Mr G: My guy is on Spotify
[16/03/2021, 10:53:16] Sam: It was really weird, my mum was best friends with his dad since they were kids but we’d never met because he lived with his mum. Then we got on a bus together one day and poof
‎[16/03/2021, 12:00:14] Sam: ‎image omitted
[16/03/2021, 12:00:24] Sam: Well, that was very insightful
[16/03/2021, 12:01:11] Sam: I definitely should have spent more of those 20 years being single rather than wasting them on complete a-holes
[16/03/2021, 12:01:37] Mr G: You actually did it 😂
[16/03/2021, 12:01:47] Sam: Once I started I couldn’t stop
[16/03/2021, 12:02:20] Mr G: I don’t remember the correct dates of who I’ve been with, but now I want to do it
[16/03/2021, 12:02:31] Sam: I had to get to 2021, this wonderful point in my life where all of that horribleness is behind me
[16/03/2021, 12:02:48] Sam: I couldn’t remember to the day, but I think it’s pretty close
[16/03/2021, 12:03:14] Sam: Funny the guys I COMPLETELY forgot even existed 🤦🏼‍♀️ cough cough Duarte cough
[16/03/2021, 12:03:19] Mr G: Fuck it
[16/03/2021, 12:03:20] Mr G: I’ll do it
[16/03/2021, 12:03:29] Sam: It’s cathartic
[16/03/2021, 12:04:23] Sam: They were always just vague bad memories, but now I can see them and define them with a colour and a length of time. My brain is very happy with this analytical approach to shelving them away
[16/03/2021, 12:05:45] Mr G: Ahahah
[16/03/2021, 12:05:52] Mr G: Man it’s so hard to remember everything
[16/03/2021, 12:05:57] Mr G: But I’m counting EVERYTHING
[16/03/2021, 12:06:08] Mr G: every girl I’ve even just kissed
[16/03/2021, 12:06:10] Sam: Is there enough colours 😂😂😂
[16/03/2021, 12:06:25] Mr G: It’s interesting to remember before my first actual girlfriend
[16/03/2021, 12:06:35] Mr G: I haven’t visited those memories in a decade
[16/03/2021, 12:06:45] Sam: All the guys I smooched ended up as bars on my graph 🤷🏼‍♀️
[16/03/2021, 12:07:03] Mr G: First fun find
[16/03/2021, 12:07:09] Mr G: I was with a girl named Samanta
[16/03/2021, 12:07:12] Mr G: 🤣
[16/03/2021, 12:07:19] Mr G: Forgot about that
[16/03/2021, 12:07:21] Sam: No way
[16/03/2021, 12:07:37] Mr G: 9 years older than me, had a child at the time
[16/03/2021, 12:07:45] Mr G: 9yo
[16/03/2021, 12:07:48] Mr G: Crazy times
[16/03/2021, 12:08:37] Mr G: Well she still has her 😂
[16/03/2021, 12:11:10] Mr G: Omg
[16/03/2021, 12:11:14] Mr G: The things I’m remembering
[16/03/2021, 12:11:33] Sam: Right?!
[16/03/2021, 12:11:39] Sam: I feel like I need a beer
[16/03/2021, 12:12:21] Mr G: There was this girl I met at a club
[16/03/2021, 12:12:32] Mr G: We never had anything but there was tension
[16/03/2021, 12:12:39] Mr G: She was wayyyy older than me btw
[16/03/2021, 12:12:43] Mr G: I was 21
[16/03/2021, 12:13:26] Mr G: And so we started texting. And she said she was about to move in with her bf and get married, but she was completely not in that mood
[16/03/2021, 12:14:27] Mr G: So she kept texting me how would it be nice for us to meet and she could forget her life for a bit.
[16/03/2021, 12:14:50] Sam: Eeew
[16/03/2021, 12:14:50] Mr G: Damn that was buried deep
[16/03/2021, 12:15:04] Mr G: I felt bad, never met her
[16/03/2021, 12:15:06] Mr G: Again
[16/03/2021, 12:15:15] Sam: That’s probably for the best 😂
[16/03/2021, 12:15:20] Mr G: Yeah
[16/03/2021, 12:16:19] Sam: I think I’ve only just settled my score with karma for being the other woman
[16/03/2021, 12:16:31] Sam: Probably shouldn’t smooch my friend anymore 😂
[16/03/2021, 12:19:54] Mr G: Loool
[16/03/2021, 12:20:00] Mr G: I wasn’t ready for this
[16/03/2021, 12:20:03] Mr G: Memory lane
[16/03/2021, 12:20:12] Mr G: The saddest thing is that some memories are sooo hard to reach
[16/03/2021, 12:20:20] Mr G: I’m not even sure what happened some of the nights
[16/03/2021, 12:23:59] Sam: This will be good for us. And even if it’s not, it’s giving me good practice with PowerBI
[16/03/2021, 12:24:05] Mr G: I think I’ve gather them all 😂
[16/03/2021, 12:24:07] Mr G: Ahaha
[16/03/2021, 12:24:13] Mr G: It’s a bit sad
[16/03/2021, 12:24:35] Mr G: To remember all of the times where it didn’t work out
[16/03/2021, 12:24:48] Mr G: For all the different reasons, plus nostalgia
[16/03/2021, 12:25:07] Sam: Try all of the times you thought they were going to kill you
[16/03/2021, 12:25:21] Mr G: Oh but I have a couple lol
[16/03/2021, 12:25:54] Sam: Ive always said to my friends I’m going to let my mouth go and get murdered by my partner and looking at this.... well, it was a real possibility
[16/03/2021, 12:25:58] Mr G: At least 1. And I have one other who I know for sure she’s capable of murder
[16/03/2021, 12:26:05] Sam: 😂😂
[16/03/2021, 12:27:21] Mr G: Checked her profile, didn’t remember I had her 😂
[16/03/2021, 13:03:23] Sam: Some of these analytics are surprising
[16/03/2021, 13:42:26] Sam: Have you been outside today?! It’s blummin lush!
[16/03/2021, 13:42:46] Mr G: I’m out now
[16/03/2021, 13:42:49] Mr G: Nuts incredible
[16/03/2021, 13:43:10] Mr G: Or as we say back in portugal, mild and cold
[16/03/2021, 13:43:12] Mr G: 😂
[16/03/2021, 13:43:17] Mr G: Jk
[16/03/2021, 13:43:24] Mr G: I love it
[16/03/2021, 13:52:39] Sam: I’m meeting a friend for a coffee at the hub later if you fancy another walk 😊
[16/03/2021, 13:59:10] Mr G: At what Time
[16/03/2021, 14:58:05] Mr G: Im up for it depending on the time! Can I bring niddy?
[16/03/2021, 15:03:35] Sam: 6-6:30ish?
[16/03/2021, 15:03:50] Sam: It would be so lovely to see Niddy! 😁
[16/03/2021, 15:18:21] Mr G: Yes
[16/03/2021, 15:18:29] Mr G: Well we might go a bit before to catch some sun
[16/03/2021, 15:40:57] Mr G: Do you want to give it a try on my hair this week then?
[16/03/2021, 15:41:29] Mr G: I’m done with it
[16/03/2021, 17:57:52] Mr G: We’re here
[16/03/2021, 18:00:24] Mr G: It’s closed
[16/03/2021, 18:00:25] Mr G: Lol
[16/03/2021, 18:17:47] Sam: Where u at?
[16/03/2021, 18:17:53] Sam: I’m at the hub
[16/03/2021, 18:18:03] Mr G: Italian place
[16/03/2021, 18:18:19] Mr G: What u wanna do
[16/03/2021, 19:34:30] Sam: Thanks for walking me back to my car 😊
[16/03/2021, 19:41:35] Mr G: 🙂

[16/03/2021, 19:49:24] Mr G: No more for me
[16/03/2021, 19:49:55] Sam: You’re the adoption centre now tho
[16/03/2021, 19:50:11] Mr G: Yes

[17/03/2021, 14:32:45] Sam: I’ve actually learned how to use tableau doing this bloody thing 😂
[17/03/2021, 14:33:53] Sam: Onto the annotation, didn’t realise my body count was in the double figures 😳 oopsy 😂
[17/03/2021, 14:34:21] Mr G: You actually annotated it 😂
[17/03/2021, 14:34:37] Mr G: Are you gonna post on r/dataisbeautiful?
[17/03/2021, 14:34:47] Sam: I think so
[17/03/2021, 14:35:06] Sam: If it looks decent when I finish
[17/03/2021, 14:35:59] Sam: It’s actually been really good for me to do this
[17/03/2021, 14:40:14] Mr G: “Slept with my friend when I was on holiday” 😂😂😂😂
[17/03/2021, 14:40:23] Mr G: Wild
[17/03/2021, 14:40:55] Sam: I nearly died from the pain of that one
[17/03/2021, 14:41:02] Mr G: Wait
[17/03/2021, 14:41:05] Mr G: Physical pain?
[17/03/2021, 14:41:10] Sam: Emotional
[17/03/2021, 14:41:19] Mr G: Are those only sex ?
[17/03/2021, 14:41:27] Sam: He was my first love ☹️
[17/03/2021, 14:42:06] Sam: No
[17/03/2021, 14:42:38] Mr G: I mean
[17/03/2021, 14:42:51] Mr G: Do these include just making out as well?
[17/03/2021, 14:43:02] Mr G: If you know what I mean 😂
[17/03/2021, 14:43:54] Sam: I’d say no (there were probably a few drunken smooches on holiday here and there) but I only really sleep with people I’m in relationship/arrangement with
[17/03/2021, 14:43:58] Sam: So it’s pretty close
[17/03/2021, 14:44:09] Mr G: I’m asking
[17/03/2021, 14:44:17] Mr G: Because I also found a few things interesting
[17/03/2021, 14:44:28] Sam: Every time I tried to have a one night stand they ended up trying to wife me 😂
[17/03/2021, 14:44:56] Mr G: My ratio of people whom I just been involved with vs people whom I actually slept is about 4:1
[17/03/2021, 14:45:13] Mr G: 3:1 i mean
[17/03/2021, 14:45:19] Sam: Ahhhh so you’re just kissing all the girls
[17/03/2021, 14:45:32] Sam: Or they’re kissing you 😂
[17/03/2021, 14:45:38] Mr G: 😂
[17/03/2021, 14:46:20] Sam: I’ve had 19 years of this relationship drama now 😳 scary
[17/03/2021, 14:47:20] Mr G: There was a girl in Erasmus whom I really fancied but never talked to. Usually saw her during Erasmus nights.
[17/03/2021, 14:47:23] Sam: Although I did have a few years off here and there
[17/03/2021, 14:47:46] Mr G: One day she and her friend come to me during a night out, and the friend says “it’s her birthday and she wants a kiss”
[17/03/2021, 14:47:53] Sam: You make me feel like such a harlot 😂 your stories are so innocent
[17/03/2021, 14:48:09] Mr G: I mean who am I to say no
[17/03/2021, 14:48:34] Mr G: I was gutted because at that time I knew my soon to be gf fancied me and the feeling was mutual
[17/03/2021, 14:48:40] Mr G: But damn why not a bit earlier
[17/03/2021, 14:49:31] Mr G: This might sound a bit...hmm...don’t know, but usually took a bit for me to sleep with someone
[17/03/2021, 14:49:37] Mr G: I never felt very comfortable
[17/03/2021, 14:49:52] Mr G: That was a bit of a challenge when I broke up with my ex
[17/03/2021, 14:49:56] Mr G: But now it’s better lol
[17/03/2021, 14:50:10] Sam: 🙄
[17/03/2021, 15:01:01] Sam: For me, I realised that all of the guys it went long term with/stayed friends after were people I knew before we got together and all the tinder guys were a disaster. 
All the men I met in Scotland were a disaster and Scottish guys are just the worst. 
And I don’t feel so bad about Duarte because when you add it up, we were together almost as long as I was with Ami, so I feel my sadness was justified 👍🏼 oh and I’ve spent 6.8 years out of the last 19 being single 🤓
[17/03/2021, 15:01:46] Sam: I’m really starting to like this data malarkey now
[17/03/2021, 15:02:32] Mr G: A lot of hate towards Scotland 😂
[17/03/2021, 15:02:48] Mr G: I was with a Scottish girl in my Erasmus !
[17/03/2021, 15:02:59] Mr G: Horrible person
[17/03/2021, 15:03:00] Mr G: Jk 😂
[17/03/2021, 15:04:50] Sam: To be fair, all guys south of Manchester were total dicks too
[17/03/2021, 15:05:10] Mr G: There’s this thin band that runs across the north of England
[17/03/2021, 15:05:19] Mr G: Manchester leeds York Newcastle
[17/03/2021, 15:05:27] Mr G: Anywhere else is utter crap
[17/03/2021, 15:05:29] Mr G: 😂
[17/03/2021, 15:05:32] Sam: Specifically just Manchester really

[17/03/2021, 15:07:15] Sam: So I need a Mancunian I’ve known for a few years that’s not more than 5 years older or younger than me. That’s the magic combination
[17/03/2021, 15:07:20] Sam: 😂😂😂
[17/03/2021, 15:07:33] Sam: Oh Cumbrians are good too
[17/03/2021, 15:09:01] Mr G: Sorry, it’s in the crap area
[17/03/2021, 15:09:49] Mr G: Omg there’s a terrible mistake on this map
[17/03/2021, 15:09:51] Mr G: My apologies
[17/03/2021, 15:10:00] Mr G: Sunderland is in the band
[17/03/2021, 15:10:29] Sam: Sunderland is okay I think?
[17/03/2021, 15:10:44] Mr G: I thought Sunderland was the enemy
[17/03/2021, 15:11:51] Sam: That guy I’ve been meeting for coffee is a Mackem
[17/03/2021, 15:13:13] Sam: But I also met him on tinder so probably a disaster
[17/03/2021, 15:13:37] Mr G: Run
[17/03/2021, 15:17:34] Sam: I feel like people would pay for this sort of relationship analysis
[17/03/2021, 15:18:01] Mr G: Maybe
[17/03/2021, 15:18:27] Sam: Or at least it would  make a cool app
[17/03/2021, 15:18:27] Mr G: But most of the info is done by the client
[17/03/2021, 15:18:33] Mr G: Gathering raw data
[17/03/2021, 15:18:43] Mr G: 👀
[17/03/2021, 15:19:34] Sam: Should we make an app??
[17/03/2021, 15:20:42] Sam: Your dev skills and my data analysis skills
[17/03/2021, 15:32:19] Sam: This is actually genius. Where else would you be able to collect data on an individuals complete relationship/sexual history? Even Facebook can’t do that
[17/03/2021, 15:34:45] Mr G: Hmm, sorry, how exactly do I need you?
[17/03/2021, 15:34:50] Mr G: 😂😂😂😂
[17/03/2021, 15:34:55] Mr G: I’m joking!!!!
[17/03/2021, 15:35:00] Mr G: Do you want to?
[17/03/2021, 15:35:15] Mr G: I’m up for it!
[17/03/2021, 15:35:56] Mr G: We will create a GitHub organisation and share repositories 🥰
[17/03/2021, 15:36:17] Mr G: You can push into my repository anytime
[17/03/2021, 15:36:29] Mr G: Week day or weekend
[17/03/2021, 15:36:57] Sam: Thats nerd code for sex btw
[17/03/2021, 15:36:59] Mr G: But honestly let’s draft it
[17/03/2021, 15:37:07] Sam: Yes
[17/03/2021, 15:37:30] Sam: I think match.com would pay big dolla for this sort of analytics
[17/03/2021, 15:38:13] Mr G: Yes
[17/03/2021, 15:38:17] Mr G: I like this idea
[17/03/2021, 15:38:24] Mr G: We need to decide on a stack
[17/03/2021, 15:38:29] Mr G: What language are you using ?
‎[17/03/2021, 15:51:41] Mr G: ‎image omitted
[17/03/2021, 15:57:50] Mr G: I’m gonna do it sam
[17/03/2021, 15:58:03] Mr G: I don’t think there’s a turning back now
[17/03/2021, 15:58:15] Mr G: I’m gonna buy the OP-1
[17/03/2021, 15:59:38] Sam: Do itttttttt!!!!
[17/03/2021, 15:59:52] Sam: I’ve just picked up my braces
[17/03/2021, 15:59:55] Sam: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[17/03/2021, 16:00:02] Sam: The lisp is sooooo baddddddd
[17/03/2021, 16:00:44] Sam: I might not be able to see you for 6 months or so 🙈😂😂
[17/03/2021, 16:02:58] Mr G: ahahaha
[17/03/2021, 16:02:58] Mr G: pic or didnt happen
[17/03/2021, 16:06:13] Sam: They’re clear, you can barely see them 😂
[17/03/2021, 16:06:33] Sam: But the Litttttthsp
[17/03/2021, 16:06:39] Sam: 🙈
[17/03/2021, 16:14:02] Mr G: Ahahah
[17/03/2021, 16:14:07] Mr G: Áudio then
[17/03/2021, 16:46:07] Mr G: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_bzpSFxlZw&ab_channel=FairbairnFilms
[17/03/2021, 16:47:50] Sam: Neighbours from hell are back at it, got the police coming out again 🙈
[17/03/2021, 16:48:17] Mr G: what happened this time? is it because of the lisp?
[17/03/2021, 16:48:19] Sam: Just had to come home from work, my mum is in bits
[17/03/2021, 16:48:26] Sam: No, fence wars
[17/03/2021, 16:48:57] Mr G: damn :/
[17/03/2021, 16:49:04] Mr G: that fucking sucks!
[17/03/2021, 16:49:09] Mr G: when will it stop?
[17/03/2021, 16:52:56] Sam: Probably once he’s got a restraining order or burnt our house down
[17/03/2021, 16:53:03] Sam: My mum is so scared
[17/03/2021, 16:53:09] Sam: It sucks
[17/03/2021, 16:53:55] Sam: He doesn’t even live there, it’s his mother in laws house
[17/03/2021, 19:13:47] Mr G: Every time he comes it’s mayhem?
[17/03/2021, 19:18:01] Sam: Yep. This is the fence he’s started building today
‎[17/03/2021, 19:18:08] Sam: ‎image omitted
[17/03/2021, 19:19:41] Sam: He smashed 2 of my mums plant pots whilst he was doing it and when my mum went out he threw £2 at her “for the damages”
[18/03/2021, 00:10:23] Mr G: How’s your mum doing ?
[18/03/2021, 00:10:38] Mr G: Wtf. That’s so fucking rude
[18/03/2021, 00:10:47] Mr G: Also, smashed 2 plants? Now it’s personal
[18/03/2021, 07:10:20] Sam: Not good, she’s even talking about calling my dad 😳
‎[18/03/2021, 09:32:01] Sam: ‎image omitted
[18/03/2021, 09:53:39] Mr G: I see a baby yoda...judging..waiting
[18/03/2021, 09:55:07] Sam: He’s wondering why I’m not playing with him today
[18/03/2021, 09:55:21] Sam: But I can’t drink tea with my braces ☹️
[18/03/2021, 11:07:47] Mr G: :(
[18/03/2021, 11:07:53] Mr G: Do you have to wear them all day?
[18/03/2021, 11:08:07] Mr G: That’s not acceptable!
[18/03/2021, 11:11:56] Sam: Yeah, they say 22 hours per day
[18/03/2021, 11:12:06] Sam: You get 2 hours off for eating and smooching 😂
[18/03/2021, 11:12:28] Sam: Honestly, I’m in a bad mood already 😂 you know how much I need my brews
[18/03/2021, 16:10:42] Sam: Ran our idea past Andy (our Nissan super nerd) and he thinks it’s fab
[18/03/2021, 16:12:24] Sam: We brainstormed some really interesting data collection techniques to pre-populate the visualisations without even entering any data
[18/03/2021, 16:13:08] Sam: He said if we want to do it, we should start with learning the ethics and security required and learn how to encrypt our data right from the start
[18/03/2021, 16:13:29] Mr G: Fuck dat!!!!
[18/03/2021, 16:13:36] Mr G: Don give a fuq

[18/03/2021, 16:14:39] Mr G: Yeah sure
[18/03/2021, 16:14:44] Mr G: But before that
[18/03/2021, 16:14:48] Mr G: We need to agree on a stack
[18/03/2021, 16:14:56] Sam: And a name
[18/03/2021, 16:15:10] Sam: I can’t be talking to guys at work about dating apps 😂
[18/03/2021, 16:16:24] Mr G: 😂
[18/03/2021, 16:16:39] Sam: I also want to create some fake data profiles because I don’t want to share my dating history with the world (any more than I already have)
[18/03/2021, 16:16:59] Sam: To be honest, I think Andy was surprised because everyone at work thinks I’m gay 😂
[18/03/2021, 16:32:54] Mr G: Yes sure! Dummy data
[18/03/2021, 16:33:06] Mr G: 😂

[18/03/2021, 16:36:35] Sam: Yup
[18/03/2021, 16:47:32] Mr G: You need to watch dark
[18/03/2021, 17:06:03] Sam: I’m nearly finished mindhunter so I’ll check it out
[18/03/2021, 17:17:15] Sam: Going to write the spec for our app tonight 🤓 what do you think of using a MEAN stack? We use JavaScript at work and I want to get more experience of express.js and node.js
[18/03/2021, 17:17:49] Mr G: Awesome! Except one minor thing
[18/03/2021, 17:17:53] Mr G: I don’t know angular
[18/03/2021, 17:18:00] Mr G: I only know react
[18/03/2021, 17:18:07] Mr G: So it would have to be MERN
[18/03/2021, 17:18:33] Sam: It doesn’t have the same ring to it but okay 😂
[18/03/2021, 17:18:32] Mr G: But that doesn’t change much
[18/03/2021, 17:18:41] Mr G: Ahaha
[18/03/2021, 17:18:46] Mr G: How did you do your thingy?
[18/03/2021, 17:18:47] Sam: merrrrrrrrnnnnnnn
[18/03/2021, 17:18:53] Mr G: What language did you use?
[18/03/2021, 17:18:55] Sam: What thingy?
[18/03/2021, 17:19:11] Sam: Oh I just used excel and tableau for the visualisation
[18/03/2021, 17:19:14] Mr G: This
[18/03/2021, 17:19:18] Mr G: Ah ok
[18/03/2021, 17:19:25] Sam: Quick and dirty
[18/03/2021, 17:19:35] Sam: Just to get a feel for how it would look
[18/03/2021, 17:22:05] Mr G: Ayyy
[18/03/2021, 17:22:07] Mr G: Excited
[18/03/2021, 17:22:14] Mr G: Check D3.js
[18/03/2021, 17:23:18] Sam: Andy also mentioned running our idea past a psychologist kind of person to identify any major red flags
[18/03/2021, 17:25:04] Sam: I imagine this sort of thing could be quite upsetting to a person if you presented the facts in harsh way (you’re a hoe who will never find love and you wasted 20 years of your life on losers)
[18/03/2021, 17:25:08] Sam: Sounds like me 😂
[18/03/2021, 17:25:49] Sam: Thought we could ask Anna Wipich to give us her thoughts
[18/03/2021, 17:27:17] Mr G: Lool
[18/03/2021, 17:27:30] Mr G: Look, this is exciting and all but I just want some coding fun 😂
[18/03/2021, 17:27:45] Mr G: Also there’s nothing wrong with presenting the data
[18/03/2021, 17:35:25] Sam: I was also of this opinion, but we’re engineers and pretty analytical
[18/03/2021, 17:52:07] Sam: Chloes getting made redundant
[18/03/2021, 18:02:22] Mr G: Ohhhh
[18/03/2021, 18:02:30] Mr G: Tbh, kind of jealous 😅
[18/03/2021, 18:02:40] Mr G: What happened ?
[18/03/2021, 18:04:39] Sam: Management told her to put in for voluntary because she’s definitely going

[19/03/2021, 23:27:04] Mr G: Done!

[19/03/2021, 23:37:06] Mr G: Legit!

[19/03/2021, 23:37:19] Sam: Finally
[19/03/2021, 23:37:35] Mr G: But I’m already insecure about it
[19/03/2021, 23:37:52] Mr G: I feel like a geordie teenager 😂
[20/03/2021, 11:57:29] Mr G: I can’t get used to what I’m seeing in the mirror 😂
[20/03/2021, 11:57:36] Mr G: I think I’m going to trim it by myself
[20/03/2021, 11:57:47] Mr G: Which will have an amazing result or course
[20/03/2021, 12:53:12] Sam: Honey, step away from the mirror! 😂

[20/03/2021, 13:14:32] Mr G: This is scientific enough
[20/03/2021, 13:18:44] Sam: 850% 😳
[20/03/2021, 13:19:09] Sam: This data is clearly flawed
[20/03/2021, 19:34:28] Sam: Do you want to come to a bbq tomorrow?
[20/03/2021, 19:34:51] Mr G: Sounds good! What time? And where ?
[20/03/2021, 19:41:05] Sam: At Jayne’s tomorrow afternoon
[20/03/2021, 19:43:58] Mr G: 👍🏻
[20/03/2021, 19:44:04] Mr G: At what time ?
[20/03/2021, 19:44:56] Sam: I was just going to head round after I’ve finished working on the house
[20/03/2021, 19:45:11] Sam: About 3ish?
[20/03/2021, 19:50:08] Mr G: 👌

[21/03/2021, 00:17:58] Mr G: Please be honest
[21/03/2021, 00:18:07] Mr G: Because I’ll probably trim it

[21/03/2021, 13:53:09] Sam: Maybe that jumper I like 😇
[21/03/2021, 13:53:11] Mr G: Should I bring anything from the shop?

[21/03/2021, 22:54:16] Mr G: Don’t worry
[21/03/2021, 22:54:29] Mr G: You’ll feel like that til the end of the series 😂
[21/03/2021, 23:03:07] Sam: 😳
[21/03/2021, 23:03:54] Sam: Also there’s so kid with his eyes burnt out... you said this wasn’t scary!
[21/03/2021, 23:04:13] Mr G: That’s not scary
[21/03/2021, 23:04:16] Mr G: Maybe a bit gory
[21/03/2021, 23:04:28] Sam: I’m scared!!
[21/03/2021, 23:04:45] Mr G: It will be worth it
[21/03/2021, 23:04:54] Mr G: The series is not meant to be spooky
[21/03/2021, 23:05:23] Sam: Lots of fellow gingers in this tho 👌🏼
[21/03/2021, 23:05:38] Sam: 👩🏼‍🦰✨

[23/03/2021, 13:49:36] Mr G: It’s amazing!!!
[23/03/2021, 13:49:44] Mr G: First of all, heavy, solid and metallic
[23/03/2021, 13:49:49] Mr G: Not expecting it
[23/03/2021, 13:50:15] Sam: Oooohhhhhh
[23/03/2021, 13:50:21] Sam: Does it have “the weight”
[23/03/2021, 13:50:24] Sam: ?
[23/03/2021, 13:51:00] Mr G: It does
[23/03/2021, 13:51:04] Mr G: It feels incredible
[23/03/2021, 13:51:10] Sam: Gimme a size comparison
[23/03/2021, 13:51:21] Sam: Get a 50p or something

[23/03/2021, 13:52:50] Mr G: 🤣
[23/03/2021, 13:53:05] Sam: Something I can relate to 😂
[23/03/2021, 13:53:10] Sam: Like a 50p
[23/03/2021, 13:53:23] Sam: Like the peasant I am 😂
[23/03/2021, 13:53:55] Sam: It’s bigger than I thought 😉
[23/03/2021, 13:54:45] Mr G: It’s average ok? It gets the job done and that’s what matter
[23/03/2021, 13:54:47] Mr G: Matters
[23/03/2021, 13:54:49] Mr G: 😂
[23/03/2021, 13:58:36] Sam: I want to ask when you’re going to play with it (or better yet, let me play with it) but you’ve ruined the tone of this conversation now 😭😭😂😂
[23/03/2021, 14:04:42] Mr G: Elevated you mean 😂
[23/03/2021, 14:04:57] Mr G: I don’t know. I want to do it when I’m on the right mood and time to learn how to use it
[23/03/2021, 14:05:09] Mr G: I don’t want to end up prematurely producing
[23/03/2021, 14:05:20] Mr G: It’s frankly embarrassing
[23/03/2021, 14:05:23] Mr G: 😂
[23/03/2021, 14:06:00] Mr G: No but in all seriousness, I’ll need some hours to learn the basics at least. I turned it one and was instantly lost lol
[23/03/2021, 14:43:52] Sam: Nothing worse than a premature production before you’ve even spent time appreciating all the features

[23/03/2021, 14:45:17] Sam: Still 2! I dreamt my brother got his face burnt off! It’s too scary 😂😂
[23/03/2021, 14:45:29] Mr G: Come onnn
[23/03/2021, 14:45:41] Sam: I’m a frickin wimp
[23/03/2021, 14:45:41] Mr G: That’s so mild 😂
[23/03/2021, 14:46:01] Mr G: I mean it’s gruesome but it’s not the point of the series
[23/03/2021, 14:46:06] Sam: I liked it better when we watched the crown 😂
[23/03/2021, 14:46:17] Mr G: You need to watch it until the first major plot reveal
[23/03/2021, 14:46:24] Mr G: And then you’ll get hooked
[23/03/2021, 14:46:33] Sam: I’ll try it again. I’m just a bit freaked out by the neighbours at the moment and not really sleeping so good
[23/03/2021, 14:46:49] Sam: I need warm and fluffy tv before sleeps

[23/03/2021, 17:12:57] Sam: I’ll save you the Shazam
[23/03/2021, 21:41:38] Sam: Do you still want to do this app now you’ve got your new baby?
[23/03/2021, 22:05:38] Mr G: Like! Vibes with my post Malone mood
[23/03/2021, 22:06:01] Mr G: Yes sure!! I might not be super free in the coming weeks
[23/03/2021, 22:06:03] Mr G: But let’s do it
[24/03/2021, 08:46:21] Sam: Okay, let me know when is good for you 😊

[25/03/2021, 07:35:50] Sam: Can I ask your opinion on the other night?
[25/03/2021, 08:58:38] Mr G: What night?
[25/03/2021, 09:40:38] Sam: At Jayne’s. Do you think something might have happened after we left?
[25/03/2021, 09:40:59] Mr G: What do you mean exactly?
[25/03/2021, 09:41:46] Sam: We were supposed to box on Tuesday and she cancelled
[25/03/2021, 09:42:03] Sam: Then I was supposed to drop the punchbag off on Wednesday and she cancelled again
[25/03/2021, 09:42:33] Sam: I don’t think she’s been to work since
[25/03/2021, 09:43:19] Mr G: Well I found it a bit odd that he would get completely wasted on a Sunday night, but I don’t know them, and it seemed to be something normal
[25/03/2021, 09:43:32] Mr G: Other than that nothing else seemed odd
[25/03/2021, 09:43:45] Sam: Did you see when he pushed her?
[25/03/2021, 09:43:54] Mr G: What do you think could have happened V
[25/03/2021, 09:44:01] Mr G: Yes I did and that was awkward
[25/03/2021, 09:44:15] Mr G: It felt a bit too much
[25/03/2021, 09:44:20] Mr G: But again I don’t know them
[25/03/2021, 09:44:30] Sam: Me neither
[25/03/2021, 09:44:39] Sam: Well I don’t know him
[25/03/2021, 09:44:53] Sam: I obviously know her and this is very out of character
[25/03/2021, 09:45:18] Mr G: Why do you say she hasn’t been to work?
[25/03/2021, 09:48:37] Sam: Usually I pick her up from work on my way to hers when she finishes at half 4, but when she text me to say she didn’t feel like boxing, she was already at home
[25/03/2021, 09:48:55] Sam: I’ve never known Jayne take a sick day ever
[25/03/2021, 09:52:51] Sam: Also Jayne never ever used to drink. She used to tell people she was allergic to alcohol because she hated it. I get that people’s tastes can change, but now she drinks with Mark every night
[25/03/2021, 09:53:58] Sam: I guess I just have a gut feeling something is off
[25/03/2021, 09:55:27] Mr G: Hmm not sure what could it be. Do you have any idea?
[25/03/2021, 09:55:36] Mr G: What if you asked directly?
[25/03/2021, 09:57:21] Sam: If he’s hurt her, I’m not sure if she would tell me. She knows I would probably kill him
[25/03/2021, 09:58:09] Sam: I actually threatened him with a knife the other day as a joke when I was cutting her birthday cake, saying “if you ever hurt my friend, I’d kill you” and it went down like a lead balloon
[25/03/2021, 09:58:24] Mr G: But how would that affect her the whole week as you described?
[25/03/2021, 09:59:17] Sam: I’ve taken a week off work when I had bruises I couldn’t hide
[25/03/2021, 10:00:20] Sam: Maybe I’m 100% wrong about this, I just had the gut feeling and I wanted to see if you got any bad vibes
[25/03/2021, 10:01:52] Sam: I’ve asked a few times to make plans over the next week and she keeps saying “I’ll let you know” even though I know she’s free
[25/03/2021, 10:04:35] Mr G: I got some weird vibes
[25/03/2021, 10:05:06] Mr G: But I figured it was jut because I didn’t know them
[25/03/2021, 10:05:24] Mr G: They seemed fine , he was just completely wasted
[25/03/2021, 10:05:31] Mr G: But I really don’t know :/
[25/03/2021, 10:05:48] Mr G: I think you should ask her more directly !
[25/03/2021, 10:06:27] Sam: I honestly don’t think she’d tell me
[25/03/2021, 10:06:45] Sam: But good to know I’m not the only one
[25/03/2021, 10:06:51] Sam: I’ll keep an eye on it
[25/03/2021, 10:07:01] Mr G: Then ask why hasn’t she showed up to anything
[25/03/2021, 10:07:32] Sam: Also, will you look after my plants when I’m in prison for murder if I find out he’s done something 😇
[25/03/2021, 10:07:39] Sam: Plant daddy G
[25/03/2021, 10:57:35] Mr G: Of course haha
[25/03/2021, 10:57:42] Mr G: But I don’t think anything happened
[25/03/2021, 11:02:01] Sam: 👍🏼
[25/03/2021, 11:08:12] Mr G: Sam
[25/03/2021, 11:08:18] Mr G: I need out of this
[25/03/2021, 11:08:27] Mr G: I can’t stand this anymore
[25/03/2021, 11:08:58] Mr G: Is Nissan a possibility for a civil engineer? 😂
[25/03/2021, 11:09:11] Sam: I always panic when you use my name in a text 😂
[25/03/2021, 11:09:25] Sam: We’re making 124 people redundant in the next week or so
[25/03/2021, 11:09:36] Sam: Then the re-hiring begins
[25/03/2021, 11:09:39] Mr G: Fuck I also wanted that
[25/03/2021, 11:09:55] Sam: Building group take on civil engineers but you would love digital hypercomp ❤️
[25/03/2021, 11:10:14] Sam: I just got my new iPad Pro and Apple Watch today
[25/03/2021, 11:10:36] Mr G: I’m betting more on civil engineering since i have a career and my main priority right now is get out of this project
[25/03/2021, 11:10:43] Mr G: Oh lush!
[25/03/2021, 11:11:39] Sam: So you’re going to do engineering again?
[25/03/2021, 11:11:51] Sam: You might fall in love with it again in a different environment
[25/03/2021, 11:11:59] Mr G: Ever since I started coding
[25/03/2021, 11:12:12] Mr G: I go to bed
[25/03/2021, 11:12:20] Mr G: And I do engineering the following day
[25/03/2021, 11:12:35] Mr G: Why not change this awful project
[25/03/2021, 11:12:47] Mr G: Maybe
[25/03/2021, 11:13:02] Sam: Coding is like the hot other woman tempting you away from your stable and loving engineer wife 😂
[25/03/2021, 11:13:23] Sam: Can you change projects at Aecom? Or do you think the company is the problem?
[25/03/2021, 11:13:58] Mr G: Yes. Except that hot woman has no idea that I exist and I live in my own fantasy, creeping and stalking her and having my room filled with voyeurism from her
[25/03/2021, 11:14:17] Mr G: Refusing to accept she will never acknowledge me
[25/03/2021, 11:14:35] Mr G: It’s possible but this is definitely not the right time
[25/03/2021, 11:14:48] Sam: I know the feeling 😂😂😭😭😂😂
[25/03/2021, 11:14:48] Mr G: They are also having redundancies company wide on most projects
[25/03/2021, 11:14:56] Sam: Well let’s get looking!
[25/03/2021, 11:15:05] Sam: I feel like jobs are starting to open up again
[25/03/2021, 11:15:12] Sam: And Nissan will definitely be hiring soon
[25/03/2021, 11:15:35] Mr G: Plus, not through the HR. They serve 0 purpose. It’s better through networking. But guess what, not the right time either
[25/03/2021, 11:15:39] Mr G: But I’m trying as well
[25/03/2021, 11:16:00] Sam: I get a grand if I bring in a new engineer. We could have a hell of a night out with that!
[25/03/2021, 11:17:18] Sam: 85% of our grads applied for voluntary redundancy so there’ll be a huge gap in new engineers
[25/03/2021, 11:17:32] Sam: I’ll keep my ear to the ground
[25/03/2021, 11:19:04] Mr G: Ayy thank you
[25/03/2021, 11:19:30] Mr G: In Aecom is the same except for graduates lol
[25/03/2021, 11:19:43] Mr G: Btw
[25/03/2021, 11:19:54] Mr G: I feel like a kid with the op-1
[25/03/2021, 11:20:00] Mr G: This is soooo much fun
[25/03/2021, 11:20:10] Sam: ❤️

[25/03/2021, 15:42:15] Sam: She text me back. She said she’s just feeling really down at the moment 😕 I’ll see if I can get her out for a walk or something this weekend and have a proper chat about it
[25/03/2021, 15:56:27] Mr G: Yes! Do that
